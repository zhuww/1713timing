We report 21-yr timing of one of the most precise pulsars: PSR J1713+0747. The pulsar's pulse times of arrival are well modeled, with residuals having WRMS of $\sim92$ns, by a comprehensive pulsar binary model including the mass and three-dimensional orbit of its white dwarf companion and a noise model that incorporates short- and long-timescale correlated noise such as jitter and red noise. The new dataset allows us to improve previous measurements of the system properties, including the masses of the neutron star ($1.31\pm0.11$ \Msun) and white dwarf ($0.286\pm0.012$ \Msun) as well as their parallax distance $1.15\pm0.03$ kpc. We measured the intrinsic change in binary orbital period, $\dot{P}^{\rm Int}_{\rm b}$, is $-0.20\pm0.17$ ps s$^{-1}$, not distinguishable from zero. This result, combined with those of other pulsar binaries, can place limits on potential changes in the gravitational constant $G$ as predicted in some alternative theories of gravitation. We found that $\dot{G}/G$ is consistent with zero [$(-0.6\pm1.1)\times10^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$, 95\%CL] and changes at least a factor of $31$ (99.7\%CL) more slowly than the average expansion rate of the Universe. This is the best $\dot{G}/G$ limit from pulsar binary systems. The $\dot{P}^{\rm Int}_{\rm b}$ of pulsar binaries can also place limits on the putative coupling constant for dipole gravitational radiation $\kappa_D$. We found at 95\% CL $\kappa_D=(-0.9\pm3.3)\times10^{-4}$, consistent with zero. Finally, the nearly circular orbit of this pulsar binary allows us to constrain statistically strong-field post-Newtonian parameters $\Delta$, which describes the violation of strong equivalence principle, and $\hat{\alpha}_3$, which describes a breaking of both Lorentz invariance in gravitation and conservation of momentum. We found at 95\%CL $\Delta<0.01$ and $\hat{\alpha}_3<2\times10^{-20}$ based on PSR J1713+0747.
