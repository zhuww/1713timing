\subsection{Orbit and proper motion}
Probably only need to show someMCMC histograms and the parameter numbers, as the details
has been extensively discussed in SNS05.
\subsection{T2 model versus DD?}
confirms that both model gives pretty much consistent results?

\section{Timing residual}

\subsection{Covariance with DM changes}
The lower band residuals are covariant with the DM changes.
\subsection{Compare generations of instruments}
Radiometer equation; Limit to the timing precision; Pulse jitter noise.
\subsection{Timing Noise?}

\subsection{Crude implication to GWB limit?}
