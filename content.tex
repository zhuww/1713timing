%Pulsars are precise cosmic clocks and excellent testing grounds for
%fundamental physics, especially for testing gravitational theories. 
We report 21-yr timing of one of the most precise
pulsars: PSR~J1713+0747. The pulsar's pulse times of arrival are well
modeled, with residuals having weighted root mean square of $\sim 92$~ns, by a
comprehensive pulsar binary model including the mass and three-dimensional orbit of its
white dwarf companion and a noise model that incorporates short- and
long-timescale correlated noise such as jitter and red noise. 
The new dataset allows us to update and greatly improve previous measurements
of the system properties, including the masses of the neutron star
($1.31\pm0.11$~\Msun) and white dwarf ($0.286\pm0.012$~\Msun) as well as their parallax 
distance $1.15\pm0.03$~kpc.  
We measured a change in the observed orbital period of PSR~J1713+0747, which
we attribute to the relative motion of the binary system and the Earth. 
The intrinsic change in orbital period, $\dot{P}^{\rm Int}_{\rm b}$, is $-0.20\pm0.17$~ps~s$^{-1}$,
not distinguishable from zero.
This result, combined with the measured $\dot{P}^{\rm Int}_{\rm b}$ of other
pulsars, can place limits on potential changes in the gravitational constant $G$
as predicted in some alternative theories of gravitation. 
We found that $\dot{G}/G$ is consistent with zero
[$(-0.6\pm1.1)\times10^{-12}$~yr$^{-1}$, 95\% confidence level] and changes at 
least a factor of $31$ (99.7\% confidence level) more slowly than the average expansion 
rate of the Universe. This is the best $\dot{G}/G$ limit from pulsar binary
systems.
The $\dot{P}^{\rm Int}_{\rm b}$ of pulsar binaries can also place limits on the putative coupling
constant for dipole gravitational radiation $\kappa_D$.
We found at 95\% confidence level $\kappa_D=(-0.9\pm3.3)\times10^{-4}$, consistent with zero.
Finally, the nearly circular orbit of this pulsar binary allow us to constrain statistically
strong-field post-Newtonian parameters $\Delta$, which describes the
violation of strong equivalence principle, and $\hat{\alpha}_3$, which
describes a breaking of both Lorentz invariance in gravitation and
conservation of momentum. We found at 95\% confidence level $\Delta<0.01$ and
$\hat{\alpha}_3<2\times10^{-20}$ based on PSR~J1713+0747.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%\linenumbers
We present 21-yr timing of the millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1713+0747, which
was discovered in 1993 \citep{fwc93}. It is one of the brightest pulsars timed by the
North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav;
\citealt{mcl13, dfg+13}), and has the smallest timing residual of all NANOGrav
pulsars \citep{dfg+13}.
The timing analysis reported in this paper will be incorporated into future pulsar timing array
projects.
%The timing analysis reported in this paper is pivotal to future pulsar timing array
%projects, such as the estimation of single-pulsar upper limit on the stochastic gravitational wave background.
Timing observations of this pulsar were reported previously in
\citealt{cfw94}, \citealt{lb01}, \citealt{vb03}, \citealt{sns+05}, \citealt{hbo06} and \citealt{ver09}.
We report new results that arise from a significant extension of the timing
baseline and use of wide-bandwidth, high resolution instruments that allow us
to model and account for pulse time variations due to dispersion in the interstellar medium (ISM)
(Section \ref{sec:dmx}) and small distortions of the pulsar's magnetosphere (Section \ref{sec:FD}). 

MSPs are very stable rotators due to their enormous
angular momentum. PSR~J1713+0747 is an MSP residing in a wide binary orbit with a white dwarf companion (Section \ref{sec:model}). 
The pulse arrival times of the pulsar are well fit by a binary model with
a nearly circular orbit. The masses of
the binary can be inferred through the measurement of Shapiro delay \citep{sns+05}. 
The system's distance is well-measured through a timing parallax. We detect
a changing projected orbital semi-major axis due to the orbit's proper motion
on the sky. Through the rate of change of projected semi-major axis, we can infer 
the orientation of the orbit in the sky.
This is one of the few binaries in which the 3D-orientation of the
binary orbit can be completely solved. Using 21 yrs of data, we
refine the previously-published measurements of these orbital parameters.
We observed apparent variation of the binary orbital period due to the Shklovskii effect 
and Galactic differential acceleration.
We also find stringent constraint on the intrinsic variation of the orbital
period, which enable us to test alternative theories of gravitation.
%These measurements also enable better tests of the theories of gravitation (see Section \ref{sec:res} for details).

The stability and long orbital period of the PSR~J1713+0747 binary make it the
perfect laboratory for observing the time variation of Newton's gravitational ``constant'' $G$. 
This interesting conjecture of $G$ varying on a cosmological timescale was first 
raised by \citet{dir37} based on his large-number hypothesis. 
Later this become a prediction of some alternative theories of gravitation. 
For example, the scalar-tensor theory \citep{jor55,jor59,fie56,bd61} 
modifies Einstein's equation of gravitation by coupling mass with
long-range scalar-tensor fields, and predicts that, as the universe expands,
the scalar field will also change, causing the effective gravitational constant to vary  
on the cosmological timescale. 
Similar ideas were also revisited by gravitational theories involving extra dimensions
\citep{mar84,ww86a}.
PSR~J1713+0747 is likely the best pulsar binary for testing the constancy of
$G$ thanks to its high timing precision and long orbital period. Using timing
results reported in this paper, we found a stringent generic upper limit on 
$\dot{G}$ (see Section \ref{sec:Gdot} for details). 

The PSR~J1713+0747 binary is also an excellent laboratory for testing 
the strong equivalence principle (SEP) and the preferred
frame effect (PFE; in this work, we constrain the putative post-Newtonian
parameter $\hat{\alpha}_3$ that characterizes a specific type of PFE; for
details see Section \ref{sec:sep}). 
Because the violation of SEP or the existence of non-zero $\hat{\alpha}_3$
could lead to non-GR effects that would polarize the
binary orbit and result in potentially observable effects. Some of these
effects are discussed in \citep{fkw12, will14}. We can put stringent generic
constrains on alternative theories by observing
low-eccentricity pulsar binary systems. Section \ref{sec:sep} presents the
constraint on the violation of SEP and the significance of $\hat{\alpha}_3$ from our 21 yrs of observation of PSR~J1713+0747.

\section{Observations}
\subsection{Data acquisition systems}


Our data set consists of pulse timing observations of PSR J1713+0747 at the
Arecibo Observatory, from 1992 through 2013, and at the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope (GBT), from 2006 through 2013, using a several generations of
data acquisition systems as described below (Table \ref{tab:obs}).  The first 12 yr of
these data (1992 August through 2004 May) were previously reported by
\citet{sns+05} using the Mark III, Mark IV, and ABPP systems.  In
this work, we incorporate an extension of the Mark IV data set (reduced
using the same process as \citealt{sns+05}); data collected at Arecibo
from two newer systems; and data collected at the GBT.

The earliest observations (Mark III) were made using a single telescope
receiver and hence intrinsic pulsar behavior cannot be separation from
effects of the interstellar medium.  Subsequent observations at both
telescopes were made using two receivers at widely spaced frequencies
(1410 and 2380 MHz at Arecibo; 800 and 1410~MHz at the GBT) to allow for
separation of these effects.


%Timing observations of PSR~J1713+0747 started in 1993 at the Arecibo
%Observatory. \citet{sns+05} reported the results of the first 12 yrs
%of timing observations. Since 2005 the pulsar is observed by NANOGrav approximately monthly
%at 1410~MHz and 2300~MHz by the Arecibo
%Observatory and at 800~MHz and 1410~MHz by the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
%Telescope (GBT).

%The timing observations were conducted using multiple generations of pulsar
%data acquisition systems(Table \ref{tab:obs}).
\input{obs.tex}
The earliest observations (1992--1994) used the Princeton Mark~III
\citep{skn+92}, which collected dual-polarization data with a filter bank of 32
spectral channels each 1.25~MHz wide. 
Observations between 1998 and 2004 used the Princeton Mark~IV
\citep{sst+00} instrument and the Arecibo-Berkeley Pulsar Processor
(ABPP; \citealt{bdz+97}) system  in parallel. 
The Mark~IV system collected 10-MHz passband data using 2-bit sampling. The
data were coherently dedispersed and folded at the pulse period offline.
The ABPP system sampled voltages with 2-bit resolution and filtered the passband 
into 32 spectral channels (1.75~MHz
per channel and 56~MHz in total for 1410-MHz band; 3.5~MHz per channel and 
112~MHz in total for 2380-MHz band), and applied coherent dedispersion to each
channel using 3-bit coefficients. 


%The ABPP TOAs are epoch-averaged TOAs, meaning they are collapsed in frequency
%to form one TOA per band per observation epoch, thus losing frequency resolution in the respective band. 
%This averaging was done using a previous timing solution 
%\citep{sns+05}. Thus the ABPP TOAs may be slighted biased to favor the
%timing parameters in the previous solution. We also included the original
%before-epoch-average Mark~IV TOAs, which were taken in the same epochs of the
%ABPP data. Both of the Mark~IV and ABPP  TOAs are well fitted by our new
%timing solution.


From 2004 to 2011/12, pulsar data were collected with the Astronomical Signal
Processor (ASP; \citealt{dem07}) and its Green Bank counterpart GASP \citep{dem07}.
The (G)ASP systems recorded 8-bit sampled $\sim$64~MHz bandwidth data and
applyed real-time
coherent dedispersion and pulse period folding. The resulting data contain
2048-bin full-Stokes pulse profiles integrated over 1-3 minutes. 
When observing with ASP we used 16 channels each 4-MHz wide between 1440 and
1360~MHz, and 16 channels between 2318 and 2382~MHz. 
When observing with GASP we used 12 channels between 1386 and 1434~MHz, and 16
channels between 822 and 886~MHz.
The J1713+0747 ASP/GASP data were also reported in \citet{dfg+13}.

We started using 
the Green Bank Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument (GUPPI; \citealt{GUPPI}) for GBT 
observations in 2010 and its clone the Puerto-Rican Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument
(PUPPI) for Arecibo observations in 2012. 
GUPPI and PUPPI use 8-bit sampling in real-time coherent dedispersion and
pulse period folding mode and produce 2048-bin full-Stokes
pulse profiles integrated over 10 second intervals.
When observing with the 800-MHz receiver at the GBT, we use GUPPI to collect data from 62 spectral 
channels each 3.125~MHz wide, covering 724--918~MHz in frequency. With the L-band receiver, GUPPI
uses 58 spectral channels each 12.5~MHz wide, covering the 1150--1880~MHz band. 
When observing with the L-band receiver at Arecibo, we use PUPPI to collect data
from 1150--1765~MHz using 50 spectral channels each 12.5~MHz wide. When observing with the S band,
PUPPI takes data from 1770--1880 MHz and 2050--2405 MHz using 38 spectral
channels each 12.5~MHz wide.
The spectral bandwidth and resolution provided by GUPPI and PUPPI are crucial for resolving the pulse profile evolution in frequency described in Section \ref{sec:FD}.

\subsection{Arrival time calculations}

We combine the pulse times of arrival (TOAs) used in \citealt{sns+05} and those
of the later observations, for a data span of 21 yrs, with a
noticeable gap between 1994 and 1998, during the Arecibo upgrade.
We used daily-averaged TOAs from \citealt{sns+05}, because the original 190~s integration TOAs are not accessible.
Data timestamps are derived from observatory masers and retrocorrected
to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) via GPS and then further
corrected to the TT(BIPM) timescale using the 2012 version BIPM clock corrections with extrapolations to 2013.
The TOAs are measured from the observational data through a series of
steps. First the data are folded, as they were being taken, into pulse
profiles using an ephemeris known to be good enough for predicting the
pulse period for the duration of the observation. The folded
profiles from different frequency channels and sub-integrations are
often summed together to improve the S/N of the profiles.  Orthogonal
polarizations are summed to produce a total-intensity profile.
The summed profiles are then compared with a well-measured standard
pulse profile from the appropriate frequency band. We employ
frequency-domain cross-correlation techniques \citep{tay92} to determine the phase of the pulse peak relative to the midpoint of the observation. The final TOA of a summed profile is then calculated by adding the mid-observation time and the product of pulse period and the measured peak phase.
The flux density of the pulsar in these observations can also be
measured by comparing the signal strength in the data with that of a
calibration observation taken right before or after the pulsar
observation in which a signal with known strength was injected. For
the post-upgrade Arecibo data and all the GBT data, the
flux density of the calibration signal is calibrated every month by
comparing it with an astronomical object of known and constant flux
density, in this case, the AGNs J1413+1509 and B1442+09.

\subsection{Instrumental offsets}
The telescopes and data acquisition systems introduce varying degrees of
computational and electronic delays into the measured TOAs.   Further, in many
cases, different standard pulse profiles were used to create TOAs from
different data acquisition systems.  As a result, the TOAs from different
systems differ by small time offsets.  When a transition is made from one
system to another at a telescope, typically data are collected in parallel
during a period of around a year, and those data are used to measure the
offset between data taken with the instruments.  Here we describe the measured
offsets in more detail.

There was no overlap between data taken with Mark III (through 1994) and
data taken with Mark IV and ABPP (beginning in 1998).  The offset between
these two systems was treated as a free parameter when fitting timing
solutions to the full data set.

Mark~IV and ABPP were used in parallel for J1713+0747 observations between
1998 and 2004. They collected data with different bandwidths (Table 1) and
were computed using different profile templates. To align the ABPP ToAs
with Mark IV, we fitted a phase offset between the 1410-MHz TOAs of the
two instruments, and found that ABPP ToAs trail those of Mark IV
by $0.46791\pm0.00009$ in pulse phase. In the timing modeling, we fix
the phase offsets between Mark~IV and ABPP to this value in
both 1410~MHz and 2300~MHz, and fit an extra time offset for 2300~MHz ABPP 
TOAs to account for any extra template misalignment.


Mark IV/ABPP and ASP were used in parallel for several epochs.  We fit
across the overlap data to determine the offset between the 1410 MHz
TOAs of these data sets to measure an offset of $2.33\pm10\mu{\rm s}$
(Mark IV trailing ASP). The offset between the 2300~MHz TOAs of Mark~IV 
and ASP is treated as a free parameter in the full timing solution.

For the offsets between ASP and PUPPI at Arecibo, and GASP and GUPPI
at the GBT, analysis of simultaneous observations of many pulsars,
including both pulsar signals and radiometer noise, were used to
measure very precise offsets between the instruments at each
observatory; details will be given in a forthcoming paper (Arzoumanian
et al. 2015).  Further, the same standard pulse profiles were used in
any given band.  Thus these data sets form a continuous 9-year
collection of TOAs with no arbitrary offsets.

Finally, the offset between the Arecibo 1410~MHz TOAs and GBT Bank 1410~MHz TOAs 
 was treated as a free parameter when fitting timing solutions to the full data set.  
The offset between the 800~MHz and 1410~MHz GBT TOAs and the offset between
the 1410~MHz and the 2300~MHz Arecibo TOAs are also fitted as free
parameters.  

%The backends Mark~IV and ABPP were used in parallel for J1713+0747 
%observations between 1998 and 2004. They collect data with different
%bandwidths (Table \ref{tab:obs}). Mark~IV and ABPP TOAs were computed using different
%profile templates.
%To align the ABPP TOAs with Mark~IV, we
%fitted a phase offset between the 1410-MHz TOAs of the two instruments, and found
%that ABPP 1410-MHz TOAs trail those of Mark~IV by $\simeq0.46791$  %$0.46791205$
%in pulse phase.
%However, due to the difference in bandwidth and center frequencies, the S-band
%ABPP TOAs trail Mark~IV slightly more than aforementioned, and the exact
%offset value depends on our model of the profile evolution in frequency (FD
%model; see Section \ref{sec:FD} for details). Therefore, in
%addition to fixing the aforementioned phase offset, we also 
%fit the S-band ABPP TOAs with an extra time offset as an unknown parameter.

%During the transition from Mark~IV/ABPP to the ASP backend, Mark~IV
%was kept running in parallel with ASP for several epochs. 
%The overlapping Mark~IV data were not published in previous papers. 
%We extracted TOAs from these overlapping Mark~IV data (labeled as Mark~IV-O in Table \ref{tab:obs})
%using the same template used for the published Mark~IV TOAs,
%and determined that the 1410-MHz TOAs of Mark~IV trail that of ASP by
%2.33(10)~$\mu$s. Consequently, the
%1410-MHz TOAs from Mark~IV, ABPP, (G)ASP, and (G)PUPPI form a connected time
%series spanning 16~yrs within which no unknown time offset has to be fitted. 
%Unfortunately, there are no
%over-lapping observations connecting these 16-yr data with the earliest  Mark~III TOAs. 
%Time offsets have to be
%fitted for the 1410-MHz Mark~III TOAs as unknown parameters in the timing
%model. The resulting timing solution is still
%clearly phase connected because the uncertainties on these time offsets are
%much
%smaller than one spin period of the pulsar. However, these time offsets will
%slightly inhibit our ability to detect small variations in timing-derived
%parameters on time scale longer than 16 yrs.

%The backend instruments introduce varying degrees of computational
%and electronic delays into the measured TOAs. 
%As a result, the TOAs from different backends are different by small time
%offsets.
%In order to measure these offsets, we allow data to be taken 
%with both backends in parallel during a period of time, usually about few years.
%As a result, the offset between GASP and GUPPI, and the offset between ASP and
%PUPPI are well measured from these parallel observations using all NANOGrav
%pulsars. These offsets are fixed when modeling the TOAs. 

The date span, number of observation epochs, and specifications of the
systems are listed in Table \ref{tab:obs}. 



\section{Timing model}
\label{sec:model}
%We model the pulsar's timing behavior with the comprehensive model described by \citet{sns+05},
%which included the effects of pulsar spin, astrometry, orbital motion,
%Shapiro delay and dispersion due to the ISM.
We employ the pulsar timing packages {\sc TEMPO}
\footnote{\url{http://tempo.sourceforge.net}} and {\sc TEMPO2} \citep{hem06} to model the TOAs. 

The rotation of the pulsar is modeled with a low-order polynomials expansion of spin frequency 
$\nu$ and $\dot{\nu}$ (Table \ref{tab:par1} and \ref{tab:par2}) in order to account
for the pulsar's spin and spin down.

The pulsar's position ($\alpha$, $\delta$) and proper motion ($\mu_\alpha$, $
\mu_\delta$) on the sky and its parallax $\varpi$ are also measured through timing modeling. 
The distance inferred from our parallax
measurement is $D_{\rm PSR}=1.15\pm0.03$~kpc. This distance is consistent with 
the VLBA parallax distance of $1.05\pm0.06$~kpc \citep{cbv+09}.

We employed the \citet{dd86} (DD) model of binary motion to fit for the binary parameters, 
including the masses of
the neutron star ($M_{\rm PSR}$) and the white dwarf ($M_{\rm c}$) measured
through Shapiro delay (Section \ref{sec:mass}),
the orbital period $P_{\rm b}$, angle of periastron $\omega$, time of
periastron passage $T_0$, projected semi-major axis $x$ and its change rate
$\dot{x}$ due to proper motion of the orbit. 
We observed an apparent $\dot{x}$ because the binary orbit moved perpendicular
to our line of sight and caused the projection angle to change over time. This 
allowed us to determine the orientation of the orbit in the sky when combined
with the system's proper motion.
The orientation of the orbit in the sky is modeled by the
parameter $\Omega$, the position angle of the ascending node.
In {\sc TEMPO}, we grid search for the best $\Omega$ and then hold it fixed when fitting other
parameters (Table \ref{tab:par1}).
In the T2 model of {\sc TEMPO2} \citep{ehm06}, $\Omega$ is explicitly modeled and
fitted, while the changing of $x$, including the $\dot{x}$ caused by proper motion and the 
periodic changes due to orbital parallaxes of the Earth and the pulsar \citep{kop96}, are implicitly modeled and not fitted as a parameter
(Table \ref{tab:par2}).  
%
\input{tempomodel.tex}
\input{tempo2model.tex}
Compared with previous timing efforts, we detected, for the first time, an
apparent change in the binary period $\dot{P}_{\rm b}$, which we attribute to
the motion of the binary system relative to the Sun. This is described in Section \ref{sec:obdecay}.    

The DMX model was used to fit dispersion measure (DM) variations caused by
changes in the ISM along the line of sight (see Section \ref{sec:dmx} for details). The FD model was used to model profile
evolution in frequency (see Section \ref{sec:FD} for details). 

In order to account for unknown systematics in TOAs from different
instruments, and observation-correlated noise such as pulse jitter noise from pulsar
magnetospheric activity, we employed a general noise model that parameterizes both uncorrelated and
correlated noise. The noise modeling is discussed in Section \ref{sec:noise} and the
noise model parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:wrms}. 
%we use the EQUAD command in {\sc tempo} to increase the errors on
%the TOAs by adding an extra amount of error to them in quadrature, such that
%the post-fit reduced $\chi^2$ is close to unity for the TOAs of every instrument. The amount
%of extra error added for different instruments are listed in Table
%\ref{tab:equad}.

%We use the DE421 solar ephemeris instead of the DE405 used by
%\citet{sns+05} for its improved precision on the masses of the Solar system
%planets, despite that using DE405 gave us marginally better $\chi^2$
%($\Delta\chi^2\sim20$ for 16750 degrees of freedom).
We used the JPL DE421 solar system ephemeris \citep{fwb09} to remove pulse
time-of-flight variation within the solar system. This ephemeris is oriented
to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and thus our astrometric
results are also given in the ICRF frame. We note parenthetically that a
previous generation ephemeris, DE405, gave nearly identical but marginally
better timing fits ($\Delta\chi^2\sim6$ for 14528 degrees of freedom in both
{\sc TEMPO} and {\sc TEMPO2}).

The timing parameters and uncertainties are calculated using a generalized least
square (GLS) approach available in the {\sc TEMPO} and {\sc TEMPO2} software packages. 
We confirm that the majority of the pulsar-binary parameters reported by
\citet{sns+05} also successfully describe the 21-yr data set. Using a new
noise modeling technique, we detected 
a significant red noise signal that could be the same ``timing noise''
described by \citet{sns+05}.
We also detected for the first time a change in the observed orbit period.
The new timing model parameters (Table \ref{tab:par1} and \ref{tab:par2}) changed slightly from
those in \citet{sns+05} but are consistent within their reported uncertainties.

%The parameters uncertainties are estimated from a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
%\footnote{{\bfref We used a Metropolis algorithm assuming the goodness of fit of
%the timing model is proportional to $e^{-\chi^2/2}$. The procedure is similar
%to that in the {\sc tempo2} MCMC plugin \citep{dpr+10}. The code for running this
%MCMC can be found here: \url{https://github.com/zhuww/tempomcmc}}}  
%(MCMC; \citealt{NR3}) simulation to determine the parameter uncertainties (Table \ref{tab:par}).

\end{figure*} 
%
The noise model used in this analysis is a parameterized model that is a function of several unknown quantities describing both correlated and uncorrelated noise sources. Uncorrelated noise is 
independent from one TOA to another, while the correlated noise is not. 
For instance, the template matching error mostly due to radiometer noise are
uncorrelated in time, but the pulse jitter noise \citep{cs10}, which affects all the TOAs 
in the same observation simultaneously, is correlated in time.
There is also time-correlated noise, such as red timing noise that is
correlated from epoch to epoch. Among the various types of noise only the
template matching error $\sigma$ can be estimated when we compute the TOAs.
Other sources of noise must be modeled separately. The solution to this problem has been discussed extensively in \citet{vl13, ell13, vv14a, vv14, abb+14} and J. A. Ellis (PhD thesis 2014). In this section, we summarize the noise model used in this analysis \citep[see e.g.][for more details]{abb+15b}.

show the histogram of the weighted residuals (weighted by EFAC and EQUAD
corrected TOA uncertainties) in logarithmic scale in blue curves, along with a
zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian distribution marked as red dashed curves.}
\end{figure*} 

To model uncorrelated noise, we use the standard EFAC and EQUAD parameters for each
backend/receiver system (e.g. PUPPI backend with L-band receiver). These parameters
simply re-scale the original TOA uncertainties
\be
\sigma_{i,k} \rightarrow  E_{k} \left( \sigma_{i,k}^{2} + Q_{k}^{2}  \right)^{1/2},
\ee
where $E_{k}$ and $Q_{k}$ denote the EFAC and EQUAD parameters, respectively, and the subscript
$i$ is the TOA number and the subscript $k$ denotes the backend/receiver system.

To model uncorrelated noise we use the new ECORR parameter and a power-law red noise spectrum.
The ECORR term describes short timescale noise that is completely correlated
for all TOAs in a given observation
but completely \emph{uncorrelated} between observations. This term could be described as pulse phase jitter \citep{cs10}
but could also have other components. The ECORR term manifests itself as a block diagonal term in the noise covariance
matrix where the size of the blocks is equal to the number of TOAs in a given
observation. The exact details of the implementation are described in
\cite{abb+15b}; however, the term essentially acts as a
observation-to-observation variance. 
Lastly, we model the red noise as a stationary gaussian process that is parameterized by a power spectrum of the form
\be
P(f) = A_{\rm red}^2\left( \frac{f}{f_{\rm yr}} \right)^{\gamma_{\rm red}},
\ee
where $A_{\rm red}$ is the amplitude of the red noise in $\mu$s~${\rm yr}^{1/2}$, $\gamma_{\rm red}$ is the spectral index.

These noise parameters are included in a joint likelihood that contains all timing model parameters. For the purposes of this paper, we analytically marginalize over the linear timing model parameters and explore the space of noise parameters via Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). We then use the MCMC results to determine the maximum likelihood noise parameters which are subsequently used as inputs to \textsc{TEMPO}/\textsc{TEMPO2} GLS fitting routines. 
In our noise model we include EFAC, EQUAD, and ECORR parameters
for data collected by different backend and receiver systems. However, we do not model 
EFAC and ECORR of the Mark~III, Mark~IV, and ABPP data because there were not
enough TOAs in the legacy dataset to constrain both EFAC and EQUAD. Furthermore,
there was only one TOA per observation so we cannot constrain the observation-correlated
noise modeled by ECORR. Instead, we set EFAC values to 1
and ECORR to 0 for these data sets, and use only EQUAD to model the white
noise in these observations. 
The maximum likelihood values of the white noise parameters are presented in Table \ref{tab:wrms}.

\citet{sc12} studied the pulse arrival times from a single long exposure of
PSR~J1713+0747, and found that this pulsar's single pulses showed random jitter of
$\simeq26~\mu$s. 
A similar result of $\simeq27~\mu$s was found by \citet{dlc+14} from a more recent study using a 24-h continuous observation of PSR~J1713+0747 conducted with major telescopes around the globe.
Therefore, by averaging many pulses collected in the typical
$\sim20$~min NANOGrav observation, one expects $\sim27\mu{\rm s}/\sqrt{1200\nu}=51$~ns of jitter noise. 
Tables \ref{tab:par1} and \ref{tab:par2} show the best-fit timing parameters before and
after we applied our noise model to the data. It is clear that the jitter-like
observation-correlated noise affected the arrival time of the pulses, such that 
some timing parameters changed significantly after including the jitter model.
The optimal jitter parameters (ECORR, as shown in Table \ref{tab:wrms}) from
our noise modeling are mostly consistent with the prediction from
\citet{sc12}, with some of them being higher. This could be due to the
covariance between the jitter parameters and the EQUAD parameters.

In Figure \ref{fig:res} we show the red noise realization based on our best
noise model (Table \ref{tab:wrms}) and compare it to the post-fit residuals of
a {\sc TEMPO} GLS fit.
The bottom
panels of Figure \ref{fig:res} show the one- and two-dimensional posterior probability plots
of the red noise. This noise model describes the data well as we can see in
Figure \ref{fig:detres} in which the maximum likelihood realizations of red
and jitter noise are subtracted out. We see from the figure that both the high
and low frequency residuals (with red and jitter noise realizations
subtracted) are white (described by our EFAC and EQUAD parameters) and the
weighted residuals follow a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian distribution. We
do note that the normalized residuals do not seem to follow exactly the gaussian 
distribution outside of the 3-sigma range, this affects only $\lesssim0.3$\% of the TOAs 
and will not significantly affect the results presented here. 

Red noise was previously reported for PSR~J1713+0747 by \citet{sns+05}, who
modeled it using an eighth-order polynomial. The largest residual in the
present dataset appears in the time period 1999 to 2005 (Figure
\ref{fig:res}). This is when dual-frequency observations begin, and it is
possible that the red noise model is absorbing unmodeled DM variations in
singe-frequency data collected before 1999, thus making physical
interpretations of red noise difficult.

%The red noise signal seen in the data (i.e. Figure \ref{fig:res}) does not
%resemble a low-frequency sinusoid or cubic
%but instead it may be modeling a feature that is
%localized to the time period of 1999 through 2005. 
%A similar feature was also observed by \citet{sns+05}, and they modeled it
%using higher order (up to the 8th order polynomials expansion) frequency
%derivatives. Since this is when
%dual-frequency observations begin, it is possible that part of the red noise
%signal contains contributions from unmodeled DM variations in data before 1999, 
%thus making physical interpretations of red noise difficult because of the lack
%of multi-frequency data at early epochs.

%A second possibility is that there were instrumental drifts in either the
%Mark~IV or the APBB. This possibility can only be tested by examining data of
%this pulsar taken by other telescopes and instruments from the same period of
%time. 



\subsection{DM variation}
\label{sec:dmx}
The DM of a pulsar reflects the number of free electrons between
the pulsar and the telescopes and it varies because
our sight-line through the turbulent ISM and solar wind is changing as the
pulsar, the Sun, the Earth, and the ISM all move with respect to each other.
DM variation can affect the timing of high-precision pulsars significantly.

We fit simultaneously with other parameters the time-varying DM using the {\it
DMX} model in {\sc TEMPO}.
This model fits independent DM values for TOA groups taken within 14 day
intervals, except for the L-band-only Mark~III TOAs. We grouped the Mark~III
TOAs together as a single group, because their frequency resolution and timing
precision are not sufficient for measuring epoch-to-epoch DM changes.

Figure \ref{fig:dmx} shows the measured DM variation of PSR~J1713+0747.
%
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{DMX.ps} \\ 
\caption {\label{fig:dmx} The plot shows 16-yrs DM variation of PSR~J1713+0747. The dotted line shows the Solar
elongation of the pulsar. The subplot shows the structure
function (error bars) and its a power law fit (solid line). The best-fit power law index is
0.49(5), different from the value of $5/3$ expected from a ``pure'' Kolmogorov medium. } 
\end{figure} 
The sudden dip and recovery of DM around 2008 (MJD 54800) is 
due to changes either in the ISM or in the solar wind. This DM dip is also
observed independently by the Parkes observatory \citep{kcs+13}.
There is clear red-noise-like variance in the pulsar's DM with an RMS of
$\sim10^{-4}$ pc~cm$^{-3}$. 



Spectrum analysis of the time variation of flux, pulse arrival phase, and DM have 
been employed to study the turbulent nature of the ISM \citep[e.g.,][]{cpl86, rl90}.
It has been shown that DM variations of some pulsars are consistent with
those expected from an ISM characterized by a Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum
\citep{cwd+90, ric90, ktr94, yhc+07, kcs+13, fst14}. One can calculate the 
structure function of the varying DM: 
\begin{equation}
D_{\phi}(\tau)=\left(\frac{2\pi K}{f^2}\right)\langle [DM(t+\tau)-DM(t)]^2\rangle, 
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ 
is a given time delay, $K=4.148\times10^3$~MHz$^2$pc$^{-1}$cm$^3$s, and $f$ is 
the observing frequency in MHz. We expect, under the simplest assumptions, 
this function to follow a Kolmogorov power law $D_{\phi}(\tau)=(\tau/\tau_0)^{\beta -2}$, 
where $\beta=11/3$ and $\tau_0$ is a characteristic time scale related to 
the inner scale of the turbulence. The pulsars with DM variations that fit this
theory generally have large DM variations on timescale of 
years. However, PSR J1713+0747 does not show significant long-term DM variation 
(Figure \ref{fig:dmx}). Conversely, it went through a steep drop and recovery 
around 2008. If such rapid DM changes are the result of variations in the ISM along
light of sight, such ISM variations do not fit the general characteristics of Kolmogorov median. 

%DM variation could be studied using alternative methods such as Gaussian processes 
%\citep{vv14a} or optimal filtering \citep{lbj+14}, but that is out of the scope of 
%this paper.

\subsection{Pulsar spin irregularity}
\label{sec:spin}

The term ``timing noise'' in pulsar timing generally refers to the non-white
noise left in the timing residuals.
An important contribution to timing noise is expected to come from the pulsar's spin
irregularity, i.e. its long-term deviation from a simple linear slow down. 
Spin irregularity is often significant in younger pulsars, and 
may be modeled with significant high-order frequency polynomials (such as $\ddot{\nu}$, where $\nu$ is the pulsar's spin frequency). 
Potential causes of irregular spin behavior include unresolved
micro-glitches, internal superfluid turbulence, magnetosphere variations, or external torques caused by matter surrounding the pulsar \citep{hlk10, ymh+13, ml14}.
These mechanisms could lead to accumulative random perturbations in the 
pulsar's pulse phase, spin rate, or spin-down rate. 
\citet{sc10} pointed out that one could model these types of timing noise using random walks.
Random walks in phase (RW$_0$) would grow over time ($T$)
proportionally to $T^{1/2}$, random walks in $\nu$ grow proportionally to
$T^{3/2}$, random walks in
$\dot{\nu}$ grow proportionally to $T^{5/2}$.
Such spin noise would likely have a steep power spectrum with more power in
the lower frequencies. This
is considered as one of the main sources of ``red'' noise in pulsar timing.


The timing noise of radio pulsars has been studied by
\citet{ch80,cd85,antt94,dmhd95, mtem97}, and later by \citet{hlk10} and
\citet{sc10} with large samples. 
\citet{mtem97} adopted a generalized Allen Variance (traditionally used in
measuring clock stability) to characterize the timing instability of pulsars:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigmaz}
\sigma_z(\tau) = \frac{\tau^2}{2\sqrt{5}}\langle c^2 \rangle^{1/2},
\end{equation}
where $\langle c^2\rangle$ denotes the sum of squares of the cubic
terms fitted to segments of length $\tau$. 
%$\Delta_8$ is the logarithm of a dimensionless form of $\sigma_z(10^8~\rm s)$.
\citet{hlk10} found a best-fit scaling model of $\sigma_z({\rm 10~yr})$ 
from 366 pulsars:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hlk10}
\log_{10}[\sigma_z({\rm 10~yr})] =
-1.37\log_{10}[\nu^{0.29}|\dot{\nu}|^{0.55}]+0.52,
\end{equation} 
where $\nu$, $\dot{\nu}$ are the pulsar's spin and spin-down rate.
We find that \citet{hlk10}'s scaling model ($\sigma^{\rm model}_{z, \rm
10~yr}\simeq1\times10^{-12}$) over-predicted $\sigma^{\rm measured}_{z, \rm
10~yr}=5\times10^{-16}$ for PSR J1713+0747 by more than three orders of magnitude. 

\citet{ch80} defined a different timing noise characteristic $\sigma^2_{\rm
TN,2}$ based on the root mean square of residuals $\sigma^2_{\msR,2}$ from a
timing fit that does not include any higher order spin parameters like
$\ddot{\nu}$. 
The timing noise term is related to $\sigma^2_{\msR,2}$:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_{\msR,2}(T) = \sigma^2_{\rm TN,2}(T) + \sigma^2_W, 
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^2_W$ is a time-independent term caused by white 
noise in the data.
In this definition, timing noise $\sigma^2_{\rm TN,2}(T)$ grows bigger over
time while white noise stays constant.  

\citet{sc10} studied the $\sigma^2_{\rm TN,2}$ from a large sample of pulsars
including canonical pulsars (CPs) and millisecond pulsars. They found a scaling
model:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sc10}
\ln(\hat{\sigma}_{\rm TN,2}) = 1.6 - 1.4\ln(\nu) +
1.1\ln|\dot{\nu}_{-15}|+2\ln(T_{\rm yr}),
\end{equation}
where $\dot{\nu}_{-15}$ is $\dot{\nu}$ in units of $10^{-15}$s$^{-2}$, and $T_{\rm yr}$
is the observation time span in years.
This scaling model predicts that, for 21-yr timing of PSR~J1713+0747, the
residual RMS without removing timing noise $\sigma^2_{\rm TN,2}$ would be
$\sim400$~ns. The measured RMS of the red noise residual 
$\sigma^2_{\msR,RN}=364$~ns, is consistent with the extrapolation
from \citet{sc10}.  
The best-fit scaling law also indicates that the residuals of the
sampled pulsars $\hat{\sigma}_{\rm TN,2}$ seem to grow linearly with $T_{\rm yr}^2$. 
If the timing noise of the sampled pulsars is due to the accumulation of 
spin noise, and the spin noise is caused by the same physical processes,
then this RMS growth rate would imply that the spin noise of pulsars has a
frequency power spectrum of power-law index $\gamma_{\rm red}\simeq -5$. This 
spectral index is consistent with the $\gamma_{\rm red}$
from our noise model (Figure \ref{fig:res}).

It is inconclusive whether or not the observed red noise can be interpreted as pulsar spin irregularity.
Other sources of noise also could have contributed significantly.
If we do assume that they are from spin irregularity, 
the estimated maximum likelihood red noise spectral index of $\sim3$ 
favors that the pulsar spin irregularities come from
random walks in either spin phase or spin rate, although other explanations cannot be ruled out due to the
substantial uncertainty on the red noise spectral index (Figure \ref{fig:res}).

Finally, \citet{sc10} showed that the significance of timing noise coming from
gravitational wave (GW) background could be estimated as
$\sigma_{\rm GW,2} \approx$~1.3$A_0(T_{\rm yr})^{5/3}$~ns, where $A_0$ is the
characteristic strain at $f=1$~yr$^{-1}$ and $T_{\rm yr}$ is the observational
time span in years. The current best upper limit on GW characteristic 
strain is $2.4\times10^{-15}$ \citep{src+13}, which predicts an upper limit on
timing noise of $\sim500$~ns from GW background. Therefore, we
cannot rule out the contribution of gravitational waves in the timing noise.


\subsection{Pulse profile evolution with frequency}
\label{sec:FD}
After removing the dispersion that causes TOA delays proportional to $f^{-2}$,
where $f$ is the observing frequency,
 we still see small remaining frequency-dependent residuals from wide-band
observations using
different instruments and telescopes (Figure \ref{fig:FD}). 
%
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{FD.ps} \\ 
\caption {\label{fig:FD} GUPPI and PUPPI post-fit residuals versus frequency when fitted
without the FD model, showing the frequency dependence of the TOAs that is 
not accounted for by the DM. For
clarity, this plot is made using only TOAs with error smaller than 3~$\mu$s.} 
\end{figure} 
% 
It appears that the low-frequency ($\sim$800~MHz) signals lead the
high-frequency (1400 and 2300~MHz band) signals by microseconds.
The cause of such TOA evolution is not clear. It could be a change in the pulsar's
radiation pattern with frequency, or it could be the use of different
standard profiles in different frequencies. Pulsar radiation of different frequencies may originate from
different parts of the star's magnetosphere, and 
the radiation region of the pulsars' magnetosphere may be slightly distorted,
leading to a frequency-dependent radiation pattern. \citet{pdr14} and \citet{ldc+14} 
extensively discussed this phenomenon and developed TOA extraction techniques
based on phase-frequency 2-D pulse profile matching. This technique is not
yet applied to our dataset.

\citet{dfg+13} allowed an arbitrary offset between TOAs taken with different
observing systems and at different frequencies in order to model profile
evolution with frequency.
However, the number of frequency
channels has increased by a factor of ten with the modern wide-band
instruments, making it much harder to mitigate profile-frequency evolution using jumps. 
Instead, we used the {\it FD} model, a polynomial of the logarithm of
frequency (Demorest et~al.\ in prep.; solid line in Figure
\ref{fig:FD}) to fit for and removed the profile-frequency
evolution. This model successfully removes the extra
frequency-dependent residuals and it requires only four parameters in the
case of PSR~J1713+0747.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}

\subsection{Mass measurements}
\label{sec:mass}
The timing model of PSR~J1713+0747 has been significantly improved by the 21-yr timing effort.
Most notably, the pulsar and the companion masses have been more precisely
constrained (Table \ref{tab:par1} and \ref{tab:par2}, Figure \ref{fig:masses}) through Shapiro delay measurements. The
companion's mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.286\pm0.012$~\Msun\, and the pulsar $M_{\rm
PSR}=1.31\pm0.11$~\Msun\, are in good agreement with the previously measured
values \citep{sns+05}. Furthermore, we have carried out an MCMC run that uses the non-linear timing
model in order to map out any non-Gaussian correlations in parameter space. We find that the non-linear
model gives nearly identical results to the standard linear-least-squares
method of \textsc{TEMPO}/\textsc{TEMPO2}.
We note that the derived pulsar mass tends to be significantly underestimated
($\Delta M_{\rm PSR} \sim 0.3 M_{\odot}$) if no jitter parameters are included in our noise model (Table
\ref{tab:par1} and \ref{tab:par2}), suggesting that
correlated noise could significantly impact the result of high
precision timing analysis.

squares solution from \textsc{TEMPO}/\textsc{TEMPO2} The solid, dashed and dash-dotted lines represent the one, two and three-sigma credible regions, respectively.
} 
\end{figure*} 


The pulsar's mass is compatible with the distribution of pulsar masses
in other neutron star-white dwarf systems, and in good
agreement with the distribution of pulsar masses found in recycled binaries
\citep{opns12,kkdt13}. The precise measurement of neutron star masses 
may eventually help us understand the properties of matter of extreme 
density \citep{dpr+10, lat12, afw+13}.

In the standard picture of binary evolution, an MSP with a low-mass white dwarf companion must have been spun up through accretion when the white dwarf was a giant star filling its Roche lobe. 
This should lead to a strong correlation between the binary period and the mass of the white dwarf companion \citep{rpj+95, ts99a, prp02b}. 
Indeed, this picture has been supported the measurements of several pulsar
binary systems \citep[e.g.,][]{vbb+01, ktr94, th14, rsa+14}.  
The orbital period and companion mass of PSR~J1713+0747 fit
this correlation very well, thus supporting the standard MSP evolution theory. 


\subsection{Intrinsic orbital decay}
\label{sec:obdecay}
We have observed an apparent changes in orbital period from PSR~J1713+0747, $\dot{P}_{\rm b} =
(0.36\pm0.17)\times10^{-12}$~s~s$^{-1}$ (Table \ref{tab:par1} and \ref{tab:par2}).
This orbital decay is not intrinsic to the pulsar binary, but rather the
result of the relative acceleration between the binary and the
observer, i.e., the combination of differential acceleration in the Galactic gravitational potential
\citep{dt91} and the ``Shklovskii'' effect (\citealt{shk70}) which is caused
by the transverse motion of the pulsar binary relative to Earth. We have good measurements of the distance and proper
motion of the binary system, which allow us to remove these effects and study the system's intrinsic orbital decay.

The apparent change in orbital period due to differential acceleration in
Galactic gravitational potential can be derived from
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Gal} = \frac{A_{\rm G}}{c} P_{\rm b} =
(-0.10\pm0.02)\times10^{-12}~{\rm s~s^{-1}},
\end{equation}
where $A_{\rm G}$ is the line-of-sight acceleration of the pulsar binary.
$A_{\rm G}$ is obtained using
Equation 5 in \citet{nt95}, Equation 17 in \citet{lwj+09}, the
local matter density of Galactic disk around solar system \citep{hf04a}
and the Galactic potential model by \citet{rmb+14}.

The Shklovskii effect causes $P_{\rm b}$ to
change by
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Shk} = (\mu_{\alpha}^2+\mu_{\delta}^2)\frac{d}{c}P_{\rm
b} = (0.65\pm0.02)\times10^{-12}~{\rm s~s^{-1}}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the pulsar's intrinsic orbital decay is $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int}
= \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Obs} - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Shk} - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm
Gal} = (-0.20\pm0.17)\times10^{-12}$~s~s$^{-1}$, and is consistent with zero.

Due to the very long $\sim$68 day orbit, the binary's decay due to the
emission of gravitational
radiation is expected to be undetectable: $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm GR} =
-6\times10^{-18}$~s~s$^{-1}$ \citep{lk05}.  Therefore, the insignificant
intrinsic orbital decay rate is entirely consistent with the
description of quadrupolar gravitational radiation within General
Relativity (GR).

Other than the gravitational radiation, two classical effects could have played a role in
$\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int}$. One, $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{M}}$, is caused by mass loss in the
binary system, and the other, $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm T}$, is the contribution
from tidal effects.
The pulsar and the white dwarf both could lose mass due to their magnetic dipole radiation; the maximum
mass loss rate due to this effect can be estimated from the
star's rotational energy loss rate. In the case of the pulsar, $\dot{M}_{\rm
PSR}=\dot{E}/c^2$, measurable through the spin down rate of the pulsar.
The white dwarf generally loses mass at a much lower rate than the pulsar.
Therefore, orbital change due to mass loss can be estimated as $\dot{P}_{\rm
b}^{\dot{M}}\sim 1\times10^{-14}$~s~s$^{-1}$ (\citealt{dt91}; Equation 9 and 10
of \citealt{fwe+12}). This is an order of magnitude smaller than the measured
uncertainties on $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int}$.
The tidal effect in this binary system is expected to be $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm
T}\ll3\times10^{-14}$~s~s$^{-1}$ based on the most extreme scenarios (the white
dwarf spins at its break-up velocity and the tidal synchronizing time scale equals the
characteristic age of the pulsar; see Equation 11 in \citealt{fwe+12} and
references therein).
Both of these extra terms are much smaller than the observed uncertainties
on $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int}$.
%The tidal effect can be estimated to $\sim$ according to Equation 11 of
%\citealt{fwe+12} and references therein. 


\subsection{Time Variation of $G$}
\label{sec:Gdot}


%The wide orbit of PSR J1713+0747 ($\sim$68 days) makes it 
%some alternative theories of gravity, such as scalar-tensor gravity,
%predict larger orbital decays.
%Consequently, measurements of pulsar binaries' ``excess'' orbital decay
%$\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc}=\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int} - \dot{P}_{\rm
%b}^{\dot{M}}  - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm T} - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm GR}$ have been
%used to constrain alternative theories \citep[e.g.][]{lwj+09, fwe+12}. 
Based on the measurement of ``excess'' orbital decay 
$\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc}=\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int} - \dot{P}_{\rm
b}^{\dot{M}}  - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm T} - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm GR}$,
\citet{dgt88} derived a phenomenological limit for $\dot{G}$ without considering the binding energy of the stars: 
$\dot{G}/G\simeq-\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc}/(2P_{\rm
b})=(1.0\pm2.3)\times10^{-11}$~yr$^{-1}$ using the timing of binary PSR~B1913+16. 
Since then $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc}$ of pulsar binaries, including 
PSR~J1713+0747, have been used to 
constrain $\dot{G}/G$ \citep{ktr94, nss+05, dvtb08, lwj+09, fwe+12}. 
So far all pulsar observations show $\dot{G}/G$ consistent with being zero, with 
upper limits largely determined by the uncertainties in orbit decay rate, distance, 
and proper motions.
PSR~J1713+0747 has the smallest known $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc}/(2P_{\rm
b})\simeq(-0.5\pm0.9)\times10^{-12}$~yr$^{-1}$ (Section \ref{sec:obdecay}) and is
particularly useful for constraining the time variability of the gravitational
constant.

} 
\end{figure} 

\citet{nor90}, \citet{lwj+09}, and \citet{fwe+12} showed that a generic test of $\dot{G}/G$ can be archived using pulsar
binaries in a more rigorous fashion by incorporating the binding energy of the neutron stars.
The binding energy of a compact start changes with the $G$, resulting in a changing mass, this will also affect the binary orbit.
In a generic form, we could characterize this effect using a self-gravity "sensitivity" parameter $s_p$ \citep{Will93}.
The changing $G$ will now change the orbital period of a pulsar binary system \citep{nor90, lwj+09}:
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{G}} = -2 \frac{\dot{G}}{G}
\left[1-\left( 1+\frac{m_c}{2M}\right) s_p\right]P_{\rm b}.
\end{equation}
This formalism is more generic in the sense that it incorporates the compactness of the neutron star, 
but it also assumes that non-perturbative effects are absent 
and higher order contributions in the self-gravity sensitivity can be neglected.

Meanwhile, in the framework of an alternative gravitation theory that violates
SEP, a binary system may emit dipole gravitational radiation (\citealt{Will93, Will01, lwj+09, fwe+12} and references
therein). Such effects arise when the two bodies are very different in terms
of their self-gravity, i.e.  their compactness.
Under the aforementioned assumptions of neglecting non-perturbative effects and higher order contributions of self-gravity sensitivity,
this extra dipole radiation could lead to an extra orbital decay term:
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm D} \simeq -4\pi\frac{T_{\odot}\mu}{P_{\rm b}}\kappa_D S^2,
\end{equation}
\citep{Will93,lwj+09}, where $T_{\odot}=G{\rm M_{\odot}}/c^3=4.925490947$~${\rm
\mu}$s, $\mu$ is the reduced mass ($m_pm_c/M$) of the system,
$\kappa_D$ is a dipole
gravitational radiation ``coupling constant'', and $S$ is the difference
between the self-gravity ``sensitivities'' of the two bodies ($S = s_p - s_c$;
$s_p\sim0.1m_p/M_{\odot}$ according to \citealt{de92} ; and $s_c\ll s_p$).
In Einstein's general relativity $\kappa_D=0$ --- there is no self-gravity induced
dipole gravitational radiation, but it is generally not the case in alternative
theories that violate the SEP.

PSR~J1713+0747 has a wider binary orbit than most other
high-timing-precision pulsar binaries, making its $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm D}$
very small. Conversely, $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{G}}$ is larger when $P_{\rm b}$
is large. This makes PSR~J1713+0747 the best pulsar binary system for constraining
the effect of the changing gravitational constant $\dot{G}$. Limits 
on both $\dot{G}$ and $\kappa_D$ can be estimated in the same fashion as in
\citet{lwj+09}: by solving $\dot{G}$ and $\kappa_D$ simultaneously 
from the equation $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc} = \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm D} +
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{G}}$ (Equation 29 of \citealt{lwj+09}) of different
pulsars. We applied this method to four pulsars: PSR J0437$-$4715, PSR J1012+5307, PSR
J1738+0333, and PSR~J1713+0747 using timing parameters reported in
\citet{lwj+09}, \citet{fwe+12}, and this work.
The resulting confidence region of $\dot{G}$ and $\kappa_D$ is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:Gdot}.
We found, at 95\% confidence limit, $\dot{G}/G =
(0.6\pm1.1)\times10^{-12}$~yr$^{-1}$; $\kappa_D=(-0.9\pm3.3)\times10^{-4}$. 
This constraint on $\dot{G}$ is more stringent than
previous pulsar-based constraints \citep{fwe+12},
and close to one of the best constraints of this type
($\dot{G}/G=(-0.07\pm0.76)\times10^{-12}$~yr$^{-1}$) from the Lunar Laser Ranging
(LLR)
experiment \citep{hmb10}, which measured Earth-Moon distance to $\sim10^{-11}$
precision through 39 yrs of laser ranging.
\citet{fle+14} showed that $\dot{G}/G$ can be constrained to 
$(0.01\pm0.18)\times10^{-12}$~yr$^{-1}$ through the analysis of solar system planetary ephemerides.
The $\kappa_D$ limit, which is not constrained by solar-system tests, is also
slightly improved by using PSR~J1713+0747. 
The pulsar-timing $\dot{G}$ and $\kappa_D$ limits are particularly interesting 
in the testing of SEP-violating alternative theories, because they arise from 
a test using objects of strong self-gravitation. For example, in some classes of the 
scalar-tensor theories, the effect of $\dot{G}/G$ could be significantly enhanced 
in pulsar-white dwarf binaries \citep{wex14}.

\subsection{Strong equivalence principle and preferred frame effect}
\label{sec:sep}
%General relativity is the only gravitation theory that satisfies
The SEP states that the gravitational
effect on a small test body is independent of its constitution. Specifically,
this principle holds that bodies of different self-gravitation should behave the same in
the same gravitational experiments. This principle is violated in alternative
theories of gravitation like the aforementioned Jordan-Fierz-Brans-Dicke
scalar-tensor theory. The PSR~J1713+0747 binary is an excellent laboratory for testing 
effects of SEP violation. If the SEP is violated, the neutron star and the white
dwarf will be accelerated differently by the Galactic gravitational field, causing
the binary orbit to be polarized toward the center of the Galaxy. The excess 
eccentricity is expected to be (\citealt{ds91}):
\begin{equation}
|\textbf{\textit{e}}_F| = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta\, g_{\bot}
  c^2}{\msF\msG(M_{\rm PSR}+M_{\rm
c})(2\pi/P_{\rm b})^2},
\end{equation}
where $\msF$ is a factor accounts for potential changes in the periastron advance rate
due to deviations from GR, $\msG$ is the effective gravitational constant in the interaction
between the pulsar and the white dwarf, and $g_{\bot}$ is the projection of Galactic acceleration on the orbital plane 
and $\Delta$ is the dimensionless factor that characterizes the significance 
of SEP violation. We assume $\msF\msG\approx G$ here and after.
The Galactic acceleration of the pulsar system is derived from \citet{hf04a, rmb+14}.

GR predict that there is no preferred reference frame in the universe but this may
be different in alternative theories. 
%Existence of PFE would lead to the isotropic violations of the
%Lorentz invariance in gravitation and potentially the breaking of conservation of momentum.
%The existence of  
%a preferred frame would lead to polarization of binary orbits along the
%direction of a preferred frame.
The Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism parameterized possible
deviations from GR into a set of parameters (see
\citealt{will14} for the list of them), some of which are associated with the
PFE. In this work, we test $\alpha_3$, one of the PFE-related parameters. 
If $\alpha_3 \neq 0$, this would lead to both
the presence of a PFE and the breaking of momentum conservation.
A rotating body would be accelerated perpendicular to its spin
axis and its absolute velocity in the preferred reference frame.
In a pulsar binary, this effect would cause an excess in eccentricity, which can be estimated by (\citealt{de92, bd96}):
\begin{equation}
|\textbf{\textit{e}}_F| = \hat{\alpha}_3 \frac{c_p|\textbf{\textit{w}}|P_{\rm b}^2}{24\pi P}
\frac{c^2}{\msF\msG (M_{PSR}+M_{\rm c})}\sin \beta,
\end{equation}
where $\textbf{\textit{w}}$ is the absolute velocity of the binary system
relative to the preferred frame of reference, typically taken as that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), $P$ is the pulsar's spin period, $\beta$ is the
angle between $\textbf{\textit{w}}$ and the spin axis of the pulsar, and
$\hat{\alpha}_3$ is the strong-field version of the PPN parameters $\alpha_3$.
Here $\textbf{\textit{w}} = \textbf{\textit{w}}_{\odot} + \textbf{\textit{v}}_{\rm PSR}$, where
$\textbf{\textit{w}}_{\odot}=369\pm0.9$km~s$^{-1}$ is the velocity of
the solar system relative to the CMB (\citealt{hwh+09}),
and the term $\textbf{\textit{v}}_{\rm PSR}$ is the relative speed of the pulsar to our solar system. 
$\textbf{\textit{v}}_{\rm PSR}$ is only partially known because we can measure
the pulsar system's proper motion on the sky but we cannot measure its
line-of-sight velocity ($v_{\rm r}$).

Fortunately, many variables in these equations are measurable in the
case of the PSR~J1713+0747 binary. 
It is possible to constrain $\Delta$ and $\hat{\alpha}_3$ using Bayesian techniques 
by assuming certain fiducial priors for $v_{\rm r}$ \citep{sns+05, sfl+05, gsf+11}. 
In our case, we assumed a Gaussian prior for $v_{\rm r}$ centred at zero with
a width equal to the system's proper motion speed.
Based on our 21-yr 
timing of J1713+0747 alone, we find 95\% confidence limits on the violations of SEP and
Lorentz invariance $\Delta < 0.01$ and $\hat{\alpha}_3<2\times10^{-20}$, 
slightly improving the single pulsar limits from earlier data on this pulsar
\citep{sns+05, sfl+05, gsf+11}.
Stronger limits can be found by combining the results from
multiple similar pulsar systems \citep{wex00,sfl+05, gsf+11}.

\section{Summary}
In this paper, we present a comprehensive model of high precision timing observations of
PSR~J1713+0747 that spans 21 yrs. 
We improved measurements of the pulsar and its companion's masses and the
shape and orientation of the binary orbit. We also detect, for the first time, an apparent
decay of the orbit due to Galactic differential accelerations and the Shklovskii effect.
These measurements, when combined with those of other pulsars, 
significantly improve the pulsar timing limit on the rate of change of the gravitational
constant, $\dot{G}$. Although the pulsar constraint is not better than the
best solar system ones, it is nevertheless an independent test using 
extra-solar binary systems thousands of light-years away. The pulsar tests
also could be more constraining for some
classes of alternative gravitational theories that predict stronger non-GR effects in
strong-field regime \citep{wex14}.
The new best pulsar timing limit on $\dot{G}/G$ is 
$(0.6\pm1.1)\times10^{-12}$~yr$^{-1}$ ($<0.033H_0$ based on the 3-$\sigma$ limit), where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant. 
In other words, the change rate of gravitational constant has to be a factor
of at least $31$ (3-$\sigma$ limit) slower than the average expansion rate of
the Universe.

Meanwhile, the precise measurements of PSR J1713+0747's orbital eccentricity and
3-D orientation allow us to test the violation of SEP and 
Lorentz invariance with it. We found a single-pulsar 95\% upper limit on 
$\Delta <0.01$, the SEP violation factor, and
$\hat{\alpha}_3<2\times10^{-20}$, the PPN parameter that characterizes
violation of Lorentz invariance. 
Because of the different statistical analysis methods used, our 
$\Delta$ and $\hat{\alpha}_3$ limits  are slightly
different but still consistent with the results of the same tests in previous publications 
\citep{wex00, sns+05, sfl+05, gsf+11, fkw12}.
Ultimately, the newly discovered pulsar triple system PSR J0337+1715 \citep{rsa+14} 
could yield the best test on SEP violation \citep{fkw12, ssa+15, bbc+15}. In this case 
the inner pulsar-white dwarf binary is orbited by another white dwarf in an
outer orbit, making this system an excellent laboratory for testing
the free fall of a neutron star and white dwarf in an external gravity field.

We studied the time variation of PSR~J1713+0747's DM from 1998 to 2013, and
fitted the structure function of the DM variation with a power law.  
The best-fit power law index is 0.49(5), significantly smaller than the 5/3 
index expected from a ``pure'' Kolmogorov medium. This relatively flat structure
function could be the result of either the lack of long-term DM variations or an
excess of short-term variations. The sudden DM dip around 2008 (Figure
\ref{fig:dmx}) is a good example of such short-term DM variations.
Similar non-Kolmogorov DM variations have been observed in some of the
other NANOGrav pulsars (Levin et al. \ in prep.). Evidence of non-Kolmogorov behavior 
in the ISM was also found in the analysis of multi-frequency pulsar scatter times \citep{lkk15}.

As part of our timing modeling, we also included noise contribution
such as jitter and red noise
 using the GLS fit and a covariance matrix that included the
correlated and uncorrelated noise terms.
We found that our timing result is significantly affected by the noise
model, especially the jitter noise, suggesting that the adoption of jitter
modeling may be necessary in cases of high precision pulsar timing. 
We found that our noise parameters and timing residuals are consistent with the jitter
noise estimates from \citet{sc12} and the timing noise estimate from \citet{sc10}. However,
the scaling law extrapolated from large sample studies of timing noise in \citet{hlk10}
overestimated the timing noise level $\sigma_z({\rm 10 yr})$ in this pulsar.

Our noise model parameters and timing residual RMS (Table \ref{tab:wrms})
provide a crude estimation of the amount of noise in our data. The weighted
root mean square (WRMS; see Table \ref{tab:wrms} for definition) of
the 21-yr daily-averaged timing residuals is $\sim 92$~ns. 
Table \ref{tab:wrms} shows a systematic improvement in the timing accuracy of
this pulsar in the last two decades, due to advances in instrumentation.
But the improvements are not as large as expected from the radiometer 
equation, perhaps because of pulse jitter. 

%The reconstructed red noise signal is most prominent in the Mark~IV and ABPP data
%but not significant in the ASP, GASP, GUPPI, and PUPPI data.
%This is consistent with the non-detection of red noise in the five years
%ASP and GASP data by \citet{pjl+13} using an auto-correlation technique.
%It is not clear if the red noise processes in Mark~IV and ABPP data
%are from pulsar spin noise, because we cannot rule out other sources such as
%instrumental drift.
Assuming that the red noise is caused by spin irregularity,
the best-fit spectrum index is consistent with
spin irregularity that was caused by random walks in
either the spin phase or the spin rate of the pulsar, but it does not exclude other explanations
due to its large uncertainty (see bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:res}).
The observed red noise level is also consistent with the prediction
from the current best upper limit of GW background \citep{src+13}, therefore,
we cannot rule out significant timing noise contribution from GW background.
