Pulsars are excellent testing grounds for fundamental physics. As precise
cosmic clocks, they have been used in many experiments, especially in testing
gravitational theories. We report 20-year timing of one of the most precise
pulsars---PSR J1713+0747. The pulse time of arrivals of this pulsar are well
modeled by a binary model in which the 3-D orientation of the orbit can be
constrained. We found that the residuals of the timing modeling show variance
of $\sim 150$~ns. We also measured the binary orbit's apparent decay due to 
Galactic differential acceleration, and used this result to test 
theories of gravitation. 
We present a new generic limit on the change rate of gravitational
constant as predicted in some alternative theories. We found that the
changes of gravitational constant is consistent with being zero and is at 
least a factor of $\ll77$ slower than the expansion rate of the Universe. Such a
limit has important implications for the alternative theories of gravitation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\linenumbers
We present 20-year timing of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1713+0747. This pulsar was discovered in 1993 \citep{fwc93} using the largest telescope in the world, the Arecibo telescope. It is one of the brightest pulsars timed by the
North American nano-Hertz Observatory for Gravitation Waves (NANOGrav;
\citealt{ndf+12, dfg+13}), has the smallest timing residual of all NANOGrav
pulsars \citep{dfg+13}, and is one of the most well-timed pulsars in the world.
Observations of this pulsar were reported previously in
\citealt{cfw94},\citealt{ vb03}, \citealt{sns+05}, \citealt{hbo06} and \citealt{ver09}.

%The high timing precision and the long base line allowed us to precisely 
%measure the pulsar binary's orbit, masses, distance, proper motion, 
%and orientation on the sky (see Section \ref{sec:model} for
%details). 

Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are very stable rotators thanks to their enormous angular momentum. J1713+0747 is one of the most stable MSPs, and it resides in a wide binary orbit with a $\sim0.3~M_{\odot}$ white dwarf companion (Section \ref{sec:model}). 
The latest wide-bandwidth and high-resolution instruments allow us to model and account for the variation in the interstellar medium (ISM)
(Section \ref{sec:dmx}) and small distortions of the pulsar's magnetosphere (Section \ref{sec:FD}). 
After removing the ISM variation and magnetosphere distortions, the pulse arrival times of the pulsar is well modeled by the binary model.
The orbit of the binary is almost edge on and therefore the masses of the system can be inferred through the measurement of the Shapiro delay. 
The system's distance and proper motion is clearly measured through parallax method.
Furthermore, we were able to detect the changes in the length of the binary's projected semi-major axis, through which we can infer the orientation of the orbit in the sky.
This is one of the few systems, in which the 3D-orientation of the binary orbit can be completely solved. Using the 20 years data, we refined the measurements on these orbital parameters.
These measurements also enable better tests for the theories of gravitations (see Section \ref{sec:res} for details).


The stability and long-orbit of the PSR J1713+0747 binary makes it a
perfect laboratory for observing the smallest cosmic variance, one such as the
change of gravitational constant as predicted in the Jordan-Fierz-Brans-Dicke
theory of gravity, i.e. the scalar tensor theory \citep{jor59,fie56,bd61}. 
As one of the last remaining alternative theories of Gravity, the scalar-tensor theory describes a class of alternative theories of Gravity
that modifies Einstein's equation of gravitation by coupling mass with a large-scale scalar-tensor field.
This theory predicts, as the universe expands, the scalar field will
also change over time, thus lead to a changing gravitational constant. 
As a phenomenon of a cosmological time-scale, the change of gravitational constant would be very slow, however, it could still lead to very small
changes in the orbits of binary systems in the timescale of decades. 
Precisely measured orbits like that of PSR J1713+0747 can be used to test the Scalar-Tensor type theories and set upper limits on the coupling between matter and the Scalar-Tensor field (see Section \ref{sec:Gdot} for detail). 
%like Luna Earth binary or pulsar
%binaries in the matter of decades. The Luna Laser Ranging (LLR) experiment measured the
%Luna-Earth distance to $10^{-11}$ precision for a 40 years time span, and thus put a very good upper limit on the change rate of gravitational constant
%\citep{hmb10}. Recently, thanks to the high-precision pulsar time array
%projects, measurements of pulsar binary orbits have also been improved
%greatly, reaching similar precision as the LLR experiment and start to provide
%meaningful independent constrains on $\dot{G}/G$. PSR J1713+0747 is uniquely
%useful in this particular test, because of its long orbital period. Unlike in
%other pulsar binaries, where the orbital decay could be affected by
%gravitational wave radiation (as predicted by Einstein's GR or by 
%alternative theories), this system has very small gravitational radiations. 
%Therefore, it is likely the best system for testing the constancy of
%gravitational constant. We found that by combining the timing result of
%J1713+0747 with that of other pulsars', we get a significantly 
%improved upper limit on $\dot{G}/G$ compare with previous timing-based 
%limits (see Section \ref{sec:Gdot} for detail).

The PSR J1713+0747 binary is also an excellent laboratory for testing physical 
principles like the strong equivalence principle (SEP) and Lorentz invariance. 
Because small violation of these principles could polarize binary orbit and result in potentially observable effects. We can set upper limits on the violations of these principles by observing pulsar binary system. Section \ref{sec:sep} presents the constraint on the violation of SEP and Lorentz invariance from our 20 years of observations of PSR J1713+0747.

\section{Observations}
Timing observation of PSR J1713+0747 started from 1993 at the Arecibo
Observatory. Long-term timing programs started observing the pulsar in late 1998, with the direct detection of GW as a partial motivation. \citet{sns+05} reported the first 12 years timing result. Since 2005 the pulsar is observed monthly
in L band and S band by the Arecibo
observatory and in 800MHz and L band by the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope (GBT; proposal code:GBT12B-320).

The timing observations were conducted 
using multiple generations of pulsar data systems. The early year
observations in \citet{sns+05} used
 the Princeton MarkIII \citep{skn+92}, MarkIV
\citep{sst+00}, and the Arecibo Berkeley Pulsar Processor (ABPP) systems. 
In the beginning of NANOGrav observations, pulsar data are collected with the Astronomical Signal
Processor (ASP) and its Green Bank counterpart GASP \citep{dem07}. We
started using 
the Green Bank Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument (GUPPI; reference?) for GBT 
observations in 2010 and the Puertorican Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument
(PUPPI) for Arecibo observations in 2012. 
The date range, number of observation epochs, specifications of the
systems are listed in Table \ref{tab:obs}.

We combine the pulse time of arrivals (ToAs) used in \citealt{sns+05} and that
of the later NANOGrav observations. 
The data span a total of 20 years with a noticeable gap between 1994 and 1998.
The ToAs are measured from the observational data through a series of steps. First the data are folded, as they were being taken, into pulse profiles using an ephemeris known to be good enough for predicting the pulse periodicity for the duration of the observation. The folded profiles from different frequency channels and sub-integrations are often summed together to improve the S/N of the profiles.
The summed profiles were then compared with a well-measured standard pulse profile  of this frequency band. We employ the cross-correlation techniques to determine the phase of the pulse peak relate to the mid point of the observation. The final ToA of a summed profile is then calculated by adding the mid observation time and the product of pulse period and the measured peak phase.
The flux of the pulsar in these observations can also be measured by comparing the signal strength in the data with that of a calibration observation taken right before or after the pulsar observation in which a signal with known strength was injected. The flux of the calibration signal is calibrated every month by comparing it with an astronomical object of known and constant flux, in this case, the AGN J1413+1509.




\section{Timing model}
\label{sec:model}
A comprehensive timing model was described by \citet{sns+05}, this model includes the effect of pulsar rotation, astrometry, orbital motion, Shapiro delay and dispersion effect due to ISM.
We employed the pulsar timing tool \textit{TEMPO} \footnote{\url{http://tempo.sourceforge.net}} and the same \citet{dd86} (DD) model \citet{sns+05} used to fit for the pulsar's spin behavior and orbital motions. 
The T2 model \citep{??} in \textit{TEMPO2} \citep{hem06} also can be used for modeling this pulsar. We tested the T2 model and found that the best-fit its best-fit binary parameters are physically consistent with those we found using DD model.
The DMX model was used to fit DM variations caused by changes in the ISM (see Section \ref{sec:dmx} for detail). The FD model were used to model profile
evolution in frequency (see Section \ref{sec:FD} for detail). 
We used the DE421(reference?) solar ephemeris instead of the DE405 used by
\citet{sns+05} for its improved precision on the masses of the Solar system planets. 
In the pulsar model, we added an extra fitting parameter, the change rate of binary period $\dot{P}_{\rm b}$ to model a previously undetectable change in $P_{\rm b}$. This is described in Section \ref{sec:obdecay}.    
We can confirm that most of the pulsar-binary parameters that \citet{sns+05} got still works for the 20 years data. The new timing model parameters (Table \ref{tab:par}) differs from the \citet{sns+05} slightly but consistent with their reported uncertainties.


%\begin{itemize}
%\item T2 model versus DD? confirms that both model gives pretty much consistent results?
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mass measurements}
\label{sec:mass}
PSR J1713+0747's timing model has been significantly improved by the 20 year timing efforts.
Most
notably, the pulsar's and the companion's masses have been more precisely measured
(Figure \ref{fig:mass}; Table \ref{tab:par}). The
companion's mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.28\pm0.01$ and the pulsar $M_{\rm PSR}=1.28\pm0.1$ are in good agreement with the previously measured values \cite{sns+05}.
The pulsar's mass is comparable with the distribution of pulsar masses in other neutron star-white dwarf systems \citep{tc99, kkdt13}.

In the standard MSP binaries evolution picture, the MSP with a white dwarf companion must have been spun up through
accreting when the white dwarf was a giant star. Therefore the 
companion's progenitor has to be big enough to fill the Roche lobe. A wider
orbit means a larger Roche radius, thus require a more massive white dwarf 
progenitor.
Consequently, a correlation between the orbital period
of the MSP binary and the mass of the white dwarf companion is expected \citep{rpj+95, ts99a, prp02b, th14}. 
Indeed, evidences supporting this picture has been found from few other pulsar
binary systems \citep{vbb+01, ktr94}.  
The observed  orbital period and companion mass of J1713+0747 also fits this theoretical correlation very well, supporting the standard MSP evolution theory. %Notably, not all MSP companions follow the same orbital period -- companion
%mass relation, for instance, J1903+0327 has an orbit of 95~days but a
%companion of $\sim 1M_{\odot}$ \citep{fbw+11}. Such peculiar systems requires
%more than the simple scenario considered above to explain.

%Some early statistical analysis shows that pulsars 
%might have a very narrow mass distribution 1.35$\pm0.04M_{\odot}$ \citep{tc99}. 
%However, several massive ($\sim2M_{\odot}$) pulsars have been found in recent
%years (J1614$-$2230 1.97$\pm0.04M_{\odot}$\citealt{dpr+10}; J1913+0327
%1.67$\pm0.02M_{\odot}$ \citealt{fbw+11}, J0348+0432 2.01$\pm0.04M_{\odot}$
%\citealt{afw+13}) that clearly out-lie this distribution.

%J1713+0747 appears to be nominal when compared with the early year samples
%despite of its recycling history.


\subsection{DM variation}
\label{sec:dmx}
The DM of a pulsar reflect the amount of ISM between
between the pulsar and earth, and it changes as the ISM varies. For most pulsar
this change is too small to be detectable. However, for the
high-time-precision pulsars monitored by NANOGrav, this contribution cannot be 
neglected.

We fit DM variation in time using the {\it DMX} model in {\it tempo}.
The model groups observations taken within ten days and fit for one
best DM value for each group.   
This DM fitting was conducted with ToA from all instruments except MarkIII,
because MarkIII had only one frequency band (L-band) and no frequency
resolution. It is not possible to precisely measure DM from MarkIII ToAs.

The ten days grouping is justified based on the cadence of our multi-band
observations.
The Arecibo L- and S-band observations of J1713+0747 almost always happen on
the same day consecutively.
While the GBT 800~MHz and L band observations often take place on different
days spaced by only few days.
Therefore, most DM values in our {\it DMX} model were determined by ToAs from
similar epochs and from at least two frequency bands. 

Figure \ref{fig:dmx} shows the DM variation of
J1713+0747 as measured by {\it DMX} model.
Note that the sudden drop of DM around MJD-53000 was not real, it was due to
the use of different standard pulse profile templates in the calculation of
ToAs from the early instruments (MarkIV, ABPP) and the later instruments
(ASP, GASP, GUPPI, and PUPPI). The DM values inferred from these two different
profile templates are expected to have a constant offset.
Conversely, the sudden drop of DM around MJD 54800 was real and was probably
due to changes in the ISM. This DM drop is also seen from observations of
J1713+0747 using the Parkes observatory \citep{kcs+13}.
There are clear red-noise like variance in the pulsar's DM with a RMS of
$\sim10^{-4}$. 
%This DM variation may lead to ``red'' timing residuals as discussed in \citealt{kcs+13}.

It is worth noting that the first part of this DM curve (MJD$<53000$in
Figure \ref{fig:dmx}) have much larger errors than the second half.
This is because they are obtained using ToAs extracted from
MarkIV and ABPP data. MarkIV data have smaller frequency bandwidth 
compared to the later data (Table \ref{tab:obs}).
Both MarkIV and ABPP data were frequency crunched to form one ToA per band per
observation epoch, thus losing all frequency resolution. This makes it hard to
resolve the profile-frequency evolution that we see from the later data. We
also assumed the mid-frequency of the band being the center frequency 
of the ToAs, while the actual center frequency may be different due to pulse
profile evolution. This procedure is likely to produce ToAs that are slightly offset. We think this may be why the FD and
DMX model cannot completely model the red-noise signal in these ToAs, leaving
an apparent hump in the first part of the DM curve (Figure \ref{fig:dmx}) and 
a similar shape in the S-band timing residuals from MarkIV and ABPP (Figure
\ref{fig:res}).


\subsection{Timing noise}
\label{sec:noise}
The pulsar timing residuals (Figure \ref{fig:res}) are the residuals left
after we fit the ToAs with our timing model. 
This residuals is likely dominated by timing noise, DM variations, radiometer 
noises, and other sources of noises. This section discuss J1713+0747's
timing noises, i.e. ToA variations due to spin irregularities.

The term ``timing noises'' in pulsar timing generally refers to pulsar's spin
irregularity, i.e. its occasional deviation from a simple linear slow down. 
Potential causes of irregular spin behavior include unresolved
micro-glitches, internal superfluid turbulence, magnetosphere variations, or external torques caused by matter surrounding the pulsar
\citep{hlk10, ymh+13, ml14}.
Unlike the Gaussian-like noises arise in the measurements of the ToAs, the
timing noises
are accumulative over time. Therefore, they often manifests show a ``red'' 
spectrum. Timing noises are often significant in younger pulsars, and often
give rise to significant high-order frequency polynomials such as
$\ddot{\nu}$, where $\nu$ is the pulsar's spin frequency.

The timing noise of radio pulsars has been studied by \citet{antt94},
\citet{dmhd95}, \citet{mtem97} and later by \citet{hlk10} with large sample. 
Because every pulsar has its own unique timing behavior, it is
hard to quantify the level of their timing noises.
\citet{antt94} characterized the significance of timing noise using the second
spin derivative $\ddot{\nu}$, because in the scale of a few years many
pulsars show cubical shaped residuals. They define the noise factor 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:delta8}
\Delta_8 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{5\nu}|\ddot{\nu}|t^3\right).
\end{equation}
Here $t=10^8$~s$\sim 3$~yr is a fiducial time scale close to the average observation time span in \citet{antt94}.

\citet{mtem97} adopted a generalized Allen Variance (traditionally used in
measuring clock stability) to characterize the timing instability of pulsars:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigmaz}
\sigma_z(\tau) = \frac{\tau^2}{2\sqrt{5}}\langle c^2 \rangle^{1/2},
\end{equation}
where $\langle c^2\rangle$ denote the sum of squares of the cubic terms fitted segments of
the data span (of length $\tau$).
This is a more general characterization of timing noise since $\Delta_8$ is
basically the logarithm of another dimensionless form of $\sigma_z$ for
$10^8$~s time scale.

In the case of J1713+0747, the
best-fit $\ddot{\nu}$ (table \ref{tab:par}) is not statistically significant. 
Therefore, there is no evidence of significant timing noise in the
timescale of the 20 years. The only red-noise like
signal is the small hump in the early-year S-band MarkIV and ABPP timing residuals (Figure
\ref{fig:res}), and we think it is likely caused by DM variations not resolved in
these data. Figure \ref{fig:TN} 
shows PSR J1713+0747's $\sigma_z$ values for various timescales, and compares them
with the values from simulated residuals of white noises and
red noises. The $\sigma_z$ values of the real residuals seem to be consistent 
with the white noises simulations, not with the specific simulated red noise,
suggesting a lack of red noises with smaller than 1 year of typical timescale. 
This result is consistent with that of \citet{pjl+13}. They
studied the timing noises in this pulsar using an auto-correlation technique
based on 5 year NANOGrav data, and conclude that the timing residual is
consistent with mostly white noise.
The lack of short- and long-timescale red noise, if confirmed,  suggests the
deviation from simple spin down could be very small in this pulsar and its timing
residual are dominated by Gaussian-like noises such as the radiometer noise.

However, our white-noise-like residuals were obtained after we fit and remove
DM variations. \citet{kcs+13} showed that fitting for DM variation could
absorb a significant portion of the ``red'' signals in the ToAs through
numerical simulations made with ToAs of one frequency band. This means
some ``red'' timing signals from PSR J1713+0747 could be absorbed into 
our DMX model. Indeed, our noise-injection simulation (see Section
\ref{sec:res})
also show that some signals in the residuals are absorbed by model fitting
including the DM corrections.
Whether the ``absorbed'' signals are ``red'' is not clear.
%Such effect should affect our pre-2005 timing
%residuals more than the post-2005 ones. Because the post-2005 DM variations 
%are well determined by at least two wide band observations, and should
%``absorb'' less frequency independent ``red'' signals.
%Conversely, we observed no obvious increase in noise level in the post-2005
%residuals, which does not support the existence of significant
%frequency independent ``red'' noise.


\subsection{Pulse profile evolution in frequency}
\label{sec:FD}
After removing the dispersion effect that causes ToA delays of $\propto \nu^{-2}$,
 we still see small remaining frequency-dependent residuals from wide-band
observations using
different instruments and different telescopes (Figure \ref{fig:FD}).  
The cause of such profile evolution is still unknown.
We speculate that it is caused by the change of the pulsar's radiation pattern in frequency. As pulsar radiation of different frequencies may originate from
different parts of the star's magnetosphere. 
The radiation region or the pulsars's magnetosphere may be slightly distorted,
lead to a radiation pattern changing with frequency. This phenomenon is extensively discussed in Pennucci et al. 2014 in prep.

To account for this profile evolution, \citet{sns+05} fitted jumps between every two frequency channels. However, the number of frequency channels has increased by a factor of ten, making it a lot harder to mitigate profile-frequency evolution using jumps. 
Instead, we used the {\it FD} model, a polynomial of the logarithm of
frequency (P. Demorest et~al in prep.; solid line in Figure \ref{fig:FD}) to fit for and removed the profile-frequency evolution. This model can successfully remove the extra frequency-dependent residuals and it only uses four parameters.



\subsection{Timing residuals}
\label{sec:res}

The final timing residuals of PSR J1713+0747 has a weighted RMS of $\sim 0.3\mu$s. The daily-averaged residuals has a weighted RMS of $\sim 0.06\mu$s (Figure \ref{fig:res}).
%These residuals appear to be smooth and flat, except a small red-noise like
%peak in the residuals of the upper band (Figure \ref{fig:res}, bottom panel) around 2002. 
%This is likely caused by timing noise left not fitted by the cubic and quadruple polynomial fit.
However, the model fitting process, that minimize the residuals, have a tendency to ``overfit'' or 
``absorb'' part of the signals or noises in the residual, making the residuals
look flatter than they actually are. 
This is especially significant for the lower band residuals, because
the DM fitting affects the lower frequency ToAs significantly more than the
higher frequency ToAs, and is more likely to flatten their timing residuals. 
As a result we expect the residual weighted RMS to be slightly under-estimated. We can crudely quantify
this under-estimation by adding random Gaussian noise to the ToAs and
measure the responds in the post-fit residuals. Figure \ref{fig:overfit} show
the weighted RMS of the post-fit residuals as a function of injected noise level for the PUPPI L-band ToAs. 
One can see that the residual increases almost linearly as a function of the
injected noises, except that only a fraction of the injected noises are
recovered in the timing residual.
Based on such simulations, we
can estimate the fraction of actual residuals absorbed by the timing models, and use this fraction to infer the ``corrected amplitude'' of the timing residuals. 
Table \ref{tab:wrms} shows the weighted RMS measured directly from the residuals 
and the corrected RMS based on noise injection simulations. One caveat 
of this approach is that the injected noise are white, while the actual timing
residuals may compose of both white and red noises. 


The great advances in instrumentation has significantly brought down the 
level of noises in the timing residuals, also made timing model increasingly
accurate.
The latest system GUPPI and PUPPI have a much wider bandwidth (800~MHz), more than
a factor of 10 wider than their predecessors GASP and ASP (64~MHz). According to Radiometer 
equation, this bandwidth increase should lead to a factor of $\sim3$
smaller radiometer noise. 
Indeed, the smallest residuals (RMS $\sim100$~ns) come from PUPPI L-band observations
and it is clearly better than that of ASP, but not better by a factor of three
as predicted by the Radiometer equation.
\citet{sc12} studied the pulse arrival times from a single long exposure of
J1713+0747, and found that this pulsar's single pulse showed random jitter of
$\simeq40~\mu$s. Therefore, by averaging many pulses collected in the
$\sim20$~min NANOGrav observation, one expect $\sim 40$~ns of jitter noise. 
This jitter noise is not affected by the Radiometer equation and will not
decrease as bandwidth of the observations in creases.
If jitter noise is a significant fraction of the observed residuals, it might
help explain why we are not seeing the expected drop in residual levels.
%A small fraction of the observed residuals could be from other unknown sources like gravitational wave signals.
%Ultimately, the timing solution and residuals presented in this paper would be very useful for future PTA projects.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}

\subsection{Intrinsic orbital decay}
\label{sec:obdecay}
Through timing modeling, we measured a significant orbital decay from
J1713+0747, $\dot{P}_{\rm b} = 0.39(12)\times10^{-15}$s~s$^{-1}$ (Table
\ref{tab:par}. 
%Such a precise measurement can be used to test Gravitational wave radiation theories of Einstein's and beyond.
It is expected that the motion of the binary relate to the observer will
cause the orbital period to decay due to kinetic effects, i.e. radial acceleration
effect \citep{dt91} and centrifugal acceleration effect (`Shklovskii' effect;
\citealt{shk70}). Luckily, we have good measurement on the distance and proper
motion of the binary system, which allows us to remove these effects and study the system's intrinsic orbital decay.
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Acc} = \frac{A_{\rm G}}{c} P_{\rm b} =
-2.1\pm0.2\times10^{-13}~{\rm s~s^{-1}}
\end{equation}
where $A_{\rm G}$ is the line-of-sight acceleration of the pulsar binary,
this term is dominated by the difference in the Galactic accelerations of the
binary and our solar system, and is obtained using
Equation 5 in \citet{nt95}, Equation 17 in \citet{lwj+09} and the Galactic
potential model by \citet{hf04a}.
On the other hand, the centrifugal acceleration effect cause $P_{\rm b}$ to
change by
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Shk} = (\nu_{\alpha}^2+\nu_{\delta}^2)\frac{d}{c}P_{\rm
b} = 6.1\pm0.1\times10^{-13}~{\rm s~s^{-1}}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the pulsar's intrinsic orbital decay is $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int}
= \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Obs} - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Shk} - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm
Gal} = (0.1\pm1.3)\times10^{-13}$s~s$^{-1}$, and is consistent with being smaller than measurable.

There are two extra classical terms that could have played a role in
$\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int}$, one $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{M}}$ is caused by mass loss in the
binary system, the other $ \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm T}$ is the contribution of tidal effect.
The pulsar could loss mass due to its magnetic dipole radiation, the maximum
mass loss rate due to this effect can be estimated from loss rate of the
pulsar's rotational energy $\dot{M_{\rm PSR}}<\dot{E}/c^2$, that is
measurable through the spin down rate of the pulsar.
The white dwarf may loss mass in similar fashion but in much less quantity.
%\begin{equation}
%\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{m}} = 8\pi^2\frac{I_{\rm
%PSR}}{Mc^2}\frac{\dot{P}}{P^3}P_{\rm b} \sim 10^{-16},
%\end{equation}
%where $M=M_{\rm PSR} +M_{\rm WD}$ is the total mass of the system and
%$I\sim10^{45}$g~cm$^2$ is the angular momentum of inertia.
Orbital change due to mass loss can be estimated as $\dot{P}_{\rm
b}^{\dot{M}}\lesssim 1\times10^{-14}$s~s$^{-1}$ (\citealt{dt91}; Equation 9 and 10
of \citealt{fwe+12}), an order of magnitude smaller than the measured
uncertainties on $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int}$.
The tidal effect of this binary system is expected to be $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm
T}\ll1\times10^{-14}$s~s$^{-1}$ basing on the most extreme scenarios (the WD spins at its break-up velocity and the tidal synchronizing time scale equals the
characteristic age of the pulsar; see Equation 11 in \citealt{fwe+12} and
references therein in).
Both of these classical terms are much smaller than the observed uncertainties
on $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{Int}$.
%The tidal effect can be estimated to $\sim$ according to Equation 11 of
%\citealt{fwe+12} and references therein. 


Finally, due to the $\sim$68 day orbit, the binary's gravitational 
radiation is expected to be undetectable: 
$\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm GR} = -6\times10^{-18}$s~s$^{-1}$ \citep{lk05}.
This is consistent with the observed intrinsic orbital decay. Therefore,
the observed zero intrinsic orbital decay rate is well consistent with
Einstein's theory of gravitational radiation.


\subsection{Constraint on $\dot{G}$}
\label{sec:Gdot}
Although Einstein's theory predicts almost zero intrinsic orbital decay for
this system.
Some alternative theories of gravity, such as the scalar-tensor gravity,
predict extra orbital decays.
Consequently, measurements of pulsar binaries' `excess' orbital decay
$\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc}=\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm Int} - \dot{P}_{\rm
b}^{\dot{M}}  - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm T} - \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm GR}$ have been
used to constrain the alternative theories\citep{lwj+09, fwe+12}. 
The $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc}$ from the previous pulsar
observations were all consistent with being zero. Their upper limits were
largely determined by the uncertainties in the measurement of $P_{\rm b}$,
distance, and proper motions.
Thanks to the high time precision of NANOGrav observations, we can measure the
all three parameters of PSR J1713+0747 to very high precision. We got
$\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc}\lesssim(0.1\pm1.3)\times10^{-13}$s~s$^{-1}$ (Section
\ref{sec:obdecay}). 
This is the smallest fractional orbital decay rate observed in pulsar binaries
thanks to PSR J1713+0747's exceptionally large $P_{\rm b}$, and can be used to
set new limit on the alternative theories of Gravity.

Some alternative theories of gravitation predict a dipole gravitational
radiation from compact binaries (\citealt{Will93, Will01, lwj+09, fwe+12} and reference therein). Such effect arise when the two bodies are very different in terms of their self gravity, or in another word, their compactness.
This extra dipole radiation could lead to an extra orbital decay term:
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm D} \simeq -4\pi\frac{T_{\odot}\mu}{P_{\rm b}}\kappa_D S^2,
\end{equation}
\citep{lwj+09}, where $T_{\odot}=G{\rm M_{\odot}}/c^3=4.925490947$~${\rm
\mu}$s \citep{lk05}, $\mu$ is the reduced mass $m_pm_c/M$ of the system , $\kappa_D $ is dipole
gravitational radiation "coupling constant", and $S$ is the difference
between the self-gravity "sensitivity" of the two bodies ($S = s_p - s_c$;
$s_p\sim0.1m_p/M_{\odot}$ according to \citealt{de92} ; and $s_c\ll s_p$).
In Einstein's general relativity $\kappa_D=0$ --- there is no self-gravity induced
dipole gravitational radiation, but it is often not the case in alternative
theories that violate the SEP.

One particular class of alternative theories --- the Scalar-Tensor theory,
predicts another form of excess orbital decal $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{G}}$,
orbital decay due to a varying
local gravitational constant. In the framework of the scalar-tensor theories,
the scalar field that interacts with the mass has to change over time as the
Universe expands. This change will cause the locally measured gravitational
constant to vary. The changing gravitational constant will also change
the orbit of a binary system:
\begin{equation}
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{G}} = -2 \frac{\dot{G}}{G}
\left[1-\left(1+\frac{m_c}{2M}\right)s_p\right]P_{\rm b},
\end{equation} \citep{dgt88,nor90}.

The orbital period of J1713+0747 is relatively long compared to other
high-time-precision pulsar binaries, this make its $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm D}$
very small. Conversely, $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{G}}$ is larger when $P_{\rm b}$
is large. This makes J1713+0747 the best pulsar binary system for constraining
the effect of the changing gravitational constant $\dot{G}$. Limits 
on both $\dot{G}$ and $\kappa_D$ can be estimated in the same fashion as in
\citet{lwj+09}: by solving $\dot{G}$ and $\kappa_D$
from this equation $\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm exc} = \dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\rm D} +
\dot{P}_{\rm b}^{\dot{G}}$ (Equation 29 of \citealt{lwj+09}) of different
pulsars. We applied this method to three pulsars: PSR J1012+5307, PSR
J1738+0333, and PSR J1713+0747 using timing parameter reported in
\citet{lwj+09}, \citet{fwe+12}, and this work.
The resulting confidence region of $\dot{G}$ and $\kappa_D$ is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:Gdot}.
We got, at 95\% confidence limit, $\dot{G}/G =
0.6\pm5.6\times10^{-13}$~yr$^{-1}$; $\kappa_D=-1\pm2\times10^{-4}$. 
This constrain on $\dot{G}$ is more than a fact of two more strident than
previous pulsar-based constrain \citep{fwe+12}, and comparable
the best constrain of this type
($\dot{G}/G=0.7\pm7.6\times10^{-13}$~yr$^{-1}$) from the Luna Laser Ranging
(LLR)
experiment \citep{hmb10}, which measured Luna-Earth distance to $10^{-11}$
precision using 40 years of observations.
Our new pulsar-timing  $\dot{G}$ limit is a strident independent test.  

\subsection{Strong equivalence principle and Lorentz invariance}
\label{sec:sep}
Einstein's general relativity is the only gravitation theory that satisfies
the SEP, which states that the gravitational
effect on a small test body is independent of its constitution, specifically,
this principle bodies of different self-gravitation should behave the same in
the same gravitational experiments. This principle is violated in alternative
theories of gravitations like the aforementioned Jordan-Brans-Dicke
scalar-tensor theory. The PSR J1713+0747 binary is an excellent laboratory for testing 
effects of SEP violation. If SEP is violated, the neutron star and the white
dwarf will be accelerated differently by the Galactic gravity field, causing
the binary orbit to be polarized toward the center of the Galaxy. The excess 
eccentricity is expected to be (\citealt{ds91}):
\begin{equation}
|\textbf{\textit{e}}_F| = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta g_{\bot} c^2}{G(M_{PSR}+M_{\rm
c})(2\pi/P_{\rm b})^2},
\end{equation}
where $g_{\bot}$ is the projection of Galactic acceleration on the orbital plane 
and $\Delta$ is the dimensionless factor that characterizes the significance 
of SEP violation. An recent model of the Galactic acceleration can be found in
\citealt{hf04a}.

The Lorentz invariance is another principle that satisfied by Einstein's
general relativity and maybe violated by alternative theories. This principle
states that there is no preferred inertial reference frame. The violation of
Lorentz invariance would lead to polarization of binary orbits along the
direction of a preferred frame.
One can estimate such effect in the Post-Newtonian Parameterization
(PPN) framework, the excess eccentricity is expected to be (\citealt{bd97}):
\begin{equation}
|\textbf{\textit{e}}_F| = \hat{\alpha}_3 \frac{c_p|\textbf{\textit{w}}|P_{\rm b}^3}{24\pi P}
\frac{c^2}{G (M_{PSR}+M_{\rm c})}\sin \beta,
\end{equation}
where $\textbf{\textit{w}}$ is the absolute velocity of the binary system
relate to the cosmic micro-wave background (CMB), $P$ is the pulsar's spin period, $\beta$ is the
angle between $\textbf{\textit{w}}$ and the spin axis of the pulsar, and
$\hat{\alpha}_3$ is one of the Post-Newtonian parameter that characterize the
violation of Lorentz invariance. 
Here $\textbf{\textit{w}} = \textbf{\textit{w}}_{\odot} + \textbf{\textit{v}}_{\rm PSR}$, where
$\textbf{\textit{w}}_{\odot}=384\pm139$km~s$^{-1}$ is the velocity of solar system relate to the CMB (\citealt{aaa+13}),
and $\textbf{\textit{v}}_{\rm PSR}$ is the relative speed of the pulsar to our solar system. $\textbf{\textit{v}}_{\rm PSR}$ is only partially known because we can measure the pulsar's
proper motion on the sky but we cannot measure its radial velocity.

Fortunately, many variables in these equations are measurable in the
case of the J1713+0747 binary. This makes it possible to constrain $\Delta$
and $\hat{\alpha}_3$ using Bayesian techniques assuming certain fiducial
priors for the unmeasurable variables like the radial component of
$v_{\rm PSR}$ \citep{sns+05, sfl+05, gsf+11}. Based on our 20 year 
timing results, we found 95\% confidence limits on the violations of SEP and
Lorentz invariance $\Delta < 0.02$ and $\hat{\alpha}_3<1.6\times10^{19}$ based on this pulsar binary.

\section{Summary}
%over all result, most precise pulsar timing
In this paper, we present a comprehensive modeling of high precision timing observations of
PSR J1713+0747 that span 20 years. 
The pulse arrival times of this pulsar was well fit by our timing model with a
residual consistent with Gaussian white noises.
The lack of evidence of red noise in short- and long-timescale suggests that
the pulsar is spinning down regularly with little deviation, supporting the
idea that pulsars can be very stable clocks in long timescales.
A caveat to this analysis is that the timing model, especially the
\textit{DMX} model we used to model ISM variations, could ``absorb'' a fraction
of the noises in the residuals \citep{kcs+13}. To what extend does this prevent us from
seeing the red noises remains to a subject of more stringently studies in the
future.

After correcting for ``over-fitting'', the ``corrected'' weighted RMS of the post-fit residuals (Table \ref{tab:wrms}) provide a crude estimation of
the amount of signal or noise remain in the timing residuals. The estimated
weighted RMS of the 20 years timing residuals is $\sim 150$~ns. The smallest
RMS values are from the L-band GUPPI ($\sim$128~ns), S-band PUPPI ($\sim$134~ns),
clearly better than that from the older generations of instruments 
(Table \ref{tab:wrms}).
This measurement has significant implications to future pulsar timing array
projects, such as the estimating of a single-source
upper limit of the stochastic gravitational wave background.


%Change rate of gravitational constant and limit on the dipole gravitational wave radiation.
In this work, we measure PSR J1713+0747's $P_{\rm b}$ to 11 significant
digits, which allowed us to detect its orbital decay $\dot{P}_{\rm b}$ due to Galactic differential accelerations.
These measurements, when combined with that of other pulsars, can help
significantly improve the current upper limit on the change rate of gravitational
 constant $\dot{G}$ from pulsar timing, making it as good as the best
constrain of this kind from the LLR experiment \citep{hmb10}.
The new best constrain based on pulsar timing is $\dot{G}/G
=2\pm8\times10^{-13}$~yr$^{-1}\ll0.0123H_0$, where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant. . 
In another word, the change rate of gravitational constant has to be a factor
of $>77$ slower than the Universe's expansion rate.

Because $P_{\rm b}$ is a second order term in the timing 
model, its measured precision improves very fast $\delta
P_{\rm b} \propto T^{5/2}$, where $T$ is the total observational time span.
We can expect the precision of the above gravitation experiment from pulsar
timing improve very quickly and hopefully will surpass the precision of LLR
experiment in the future.

The precise measurement on the pulsar binary orbit's eccentricity and
3D-orientation enable us to test if there is any violation of SEP and the
Lorentz invariance principle. We set new 95\% upper limit on the SEP violation
factor $\Delta <0.02$ and $\hat{\alpha}_3<1.6\times10^{-19}$, these results are better/comparable
to the previous constrains from \citealt{wex00, sns+05, sfl+05, gsf+11}.
Ultimately, the best test on SEP violation should come from the newly
discovered pulsar triple system PSR J0337+1715 \citep{rsa+14}. In the case of
PSR J0337+1715, the
inner pulsar-white dwarf orbit is free falling in the gravity field of the
white dwarf in the outer orbit, making them the best laboratory for testing
the free fall of compact objects.
