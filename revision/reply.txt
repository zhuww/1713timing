We thank the referee for the very helpful comments, which have been
incroporated into the new version of the manuscript. Here we list our replies
to the referee's comments:

A paragragh (parag 5) was added to Section 3, decribing how we modeled
periastron advance rate \dot{\omega}. We also changed the value of
\dot{\omega} listed in the column 1, and 2 of Table 2 and 3 to the GR values
inferred from the binary masses reported in that column.

We reworded the sentence as suggested.

We reworded the sentences as suggested.

We deleted the repetitions.

Corrected.

When we split up the dataset, the RMS of the segments were very small 
because the red noise got aborbed by the timing model; the first segment has 
a RMS of ~89ns, and the second ~33ns.
This problem of timing model absorbing red noise, plus the varying degress 
of white noise from different systems, and the gaps in our data, make it hard
to study the scaling law of red noise by splitting up the dataset. Conversely,
our red noise model contains all the information about how red noise grows in
time, and it is not affected by the varying white noises or the data gap.
If we assume that the scaling law from eq. 7 is the result of a single unified 
physical process that affected all the CPs and MSPs in their sample, then it 
would suggest that the spin noise of pulsars has a frequency power spectrum 
of power-law index ~-5, which is consistent with our red noise model from 
this pulsar (Figure 1). This is discussed in the second last paragragh 
of Section 3.3. We think Comparing the red noise sepctral index to the 
scaling law prediction is likely a better method than splitting up 
the dataset, because it takes into account the varying degrees of white noise 
and the data gap.

We now spell out the formula and also cite the NANOGrav 9 year data release paper
for the FD model.

Yes, the reported uncertainties do take into account the substracted noise
model, becuase the noise model affects the elements in the covariance matrix used
in our generlized least square fit, and therefore gets propogate into
the final uncertainties of timing parameters. Few more sentences were added to paragh 1 
of Secion 4.1 to clarify this.

We did the experiment as the refree requested, and found compatible masses using new red noise modeling. 
A comparison of the timing parameters are summarized in the new Table 5. 
We add comment on the fact that the new red noise modeling technique yield consistent red
noise signals (realizations) from the shorter and the longer datasets, whereas the 
frequency polynomial approach tend to produce significantly different red
noise signals when the order of the polynomial or the time span of the dataset
are different.
